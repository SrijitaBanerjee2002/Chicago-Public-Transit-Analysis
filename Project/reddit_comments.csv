"I love it. It's like a museum artifact that doubles as a transit system. Parts of it for sure need upgrades, and the city could benefit from some new, modern metro-style lines like Sydney and Toronto are building, but the character of the current L is such an iconic part of the city's character.

Question though - to what extent is our affinity for the L limited to the actual elevated parts? Like, are the subways under State and Dearborn considered as 'special' as the turn-of-the-century style elevated portions of the network?"
"It needs to be upgraded, with an economy bigger then most countries on earth Chicago should be able to make every station look modern and better"
I had a higher opinion of the L before I had to ride it.
"Perhaps it could be intriguing to preserve one station as a 'Historical Gem' to honor its original design and significance. However, for the hundreds of thousands of users, as well as those working, walking, or living nearby, the overall state of disrepair these stations are in is quite disheartening. The glaring issues range from their poor condition, a lack of accessibility features for people with disabilities, to the excessive noise, inadequate lighting at night, limited space, and overall instability. Itâ€™s puzzling to see how this line has not been prioritized for renovation. In many other countries, a project to modernize such a line would have been undertaken LONG ago."
"Is that Clark/Lake station?

Yeah, I love the L. I go to Chicago frequently to moderate Quiz Bowl tournaments in Rosemont and usually take the L downtown before the tournament starts so I can sightsee. When I visited a friend at LUC we took the L everywhere. Coming from small town Oklahoma it's shocking to me how amazing it is and now I'm planning on moving to a city with public transit"
"The Loop L is so much fun to ride.

I donâ€™t think a circle line L is likely in the foreseeable future, but there could be BRTs between the radial L lines."
if only the officials here thought the same
"I'm going to Chicago soon, should I give it a try or not bother with the potential of whatever weirdos to encounter?

Admittedly been humbled by Europe being synonymous with public transit for any person of any wealth.

Still feels like unless its NYC public transit in US is synonymous with being used by lesser people per say."
"Great system overall, but a ton of missed transfers, bad integration with commuter rail, and wacky station spacing in some spots. Also service is a lot less frequent than it should be."
"The L train is a great system that can only be improved upon I would say it is in tier 2 behind cities 
Such as Washington DC and New York in terms of usability for every day activities"
Excellent city- and people-watching

I wonder if there's a way to make it quieter. I lived in Chicago for 7 years and never got used to the noise of a passing train!
Seems cool. I imagine people drinking a coffee seated at tables right next to the tracks watching trains come and pass by... You know like if the towers built restaurants with patios on the train height...
"Love the L.  I live next to 3 lines so itâ€™s easy to get around.  Couple of things I wish for and number 1 is speed.  We gotta improve speed in the next 10 years.  I would also like to see either a western or Ashland loop or line. Connecting with maybe the 47th and Western Orange on the s side and maybe the western brown line.  It seems like it would be pretty good coverage if they do that.  And ohare midway line might be helpful but I would put less priority on that unless they make it really fast, with a connection in oak park (cross the green line, and maybe Cicero hitting up either the metra or pink line). #FireDorvalCarter"
"The ""L"" is a W"
"Ooof... bro, if you're gonna call it a treasure, then at least snap a pic of a station worthy of that descriptor (like Quincy).  ðŸ˜„  LaSalle / Van has seen better days. Though I will say the Pink platform's west side view down Dearborn is pretty epic for Chicago architecture fans."
"It's not a truly comprehensive transit system, and yet it's one of the only usable light rail systems in America. I've got a real love/hate relationship with it, always have."
