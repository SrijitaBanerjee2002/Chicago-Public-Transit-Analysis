"Just remind yourself that the trains only go in two directions. It’s not like driving where you could end up literally anywhere. If you get on a train going the wrong direction, you can get off at the next stop and get on one going the right direction. Before you go somewhere, write down the steps you need to take, and just follow them. It will become second nature before long.",0
"In short a few things:

1) Leave early to allow room for mistakes or unexpected delays.  It's ok to make a mistake as you're learning how to navigate.

2) Use transit apps to plot out your route, memorize the important details like transfers, bus routes, and the station/bus stop where you need to get off.  i.e. At the Belmont station, I need to get off the red line and transfer to the brown line.

3) Just do it.  Practice makes perfect, especially if this is forming a routine.",1
Try the transit when you don’t really have anywhere to be. It’s way more stressful when you have to get to work or to an appointment. Just ride the routes and stop for coffee/lunch on the wat,0
"Google maps. It will tell you what stops to take, when the trains (supposidly) are supposed to come, etc. I didn't have a smart phone when I moved to Chicago from a small town over 10 years ago and I still sometimes get emotional riding the CTA. Why? Because it's very liberating, knowing I can get anywhere on my own, without a car. I was so isolated growing up poor in a rural area, public transit was such a life changer. I live in a close suburb to Chicago now and do have a car, but take the Metra whenever I can. It's wonderful. The anxiety goes away when you realize you aren't out any additional money by transferring. If you go the wrong direction you can easily get another direction. If you're nervous about safety, sit near the driver on the bus or in the first car with the conductor.",1
"Practice makes perfect, you’ll learn your routes and feel at home in no time. Cta workers will help you if you ask nicely and need help. Lots of other comments about apps and guides and writing out your plan are all good tips. 

I also want to mention that understanding the city’s grid, and starting to learn the major streets in their order really helps you understand exactly where one is or is talking about in the city. Every 400 and 800 block is evenly spaced, down south the numbers make this super easy. But once you learn the order is the major blocks, it’s really easy to understand how the city is organized. It’s actually very orderly, relatively. Not a requirement, but it helps me feel familiar as I move around. Thanks to my aunt who lived her whole life here and taught me about the grid and cta when I first visited applying for school. She was amazing",1
"Think of the traffic and parking nightmare and realize that even if delayed, the train is much more pleasant than having to deal with that. At least that's how I frame it for myself.",1
"The easy thing about the CTA is that each line only has two endpoints. After a short while of living here you will very easily memorize which end points are in which direction. The ease of using public transit primarily lies in your understanding of the city geography itself and not so much the train system.

You will get a hang of which trains go where very very quickly",1
"Google maps gives you step by step transit instructions you can save on your phone. You get used it pretty fast. And Chicago’s transit system is pretty well designed so it’s kinda impossible to get lost. If you’re moving here, I’d just spend a day riding the routes or the line you plan on transitting daily. Also get the Ventra app where it makes buying fares super easy.",1
"If you feel like there’s something or someone sketchy on a bus or train you’re on, don’t hesitate to move seats or train car! For example if some guy is smoking a cigarette and is speaking like a schizo.",1
"I moved to chicago from a midsize city with terrible public transit and it took me a bit to get used to it. In addition to the advice about leaving early and recognizing that the train goes both ways, I would say a good way to get used to it is to pick some sites, stores, or restaurants you want to try in other neighborhoods, and use the cta to go check them out on a day off. You'll get to see the city and you'll get use to bus and train travel.

The other thing you can keep in mind is that, despite the reputation, chicago is a pretty friendly city, and if you're really lost you can ask people for help navigating. When I first moved here I was puzzling over the train map and someone came up, unasked, and offered help. And Ive been asked for directions or offered help to lost-appearing tourists.",1
"Chicago public transit is great
.

Look at the seat before you sit down to make sure there is nothing gross on it. 
If on the El, try to avoid getting in an empty car.",1
"Always take the front car. Don't panic if you don't, but the safest area to be is always the front car.

What you fear is most likely what you've heard on the news, which will make any place sound like Gotham City.

If people spontaneously start yelling or mumbling to themselves, just keep to yourself. Avoid eye contact if possible.

Wear sunglasses and put earbuds on. If people can't see your eyes, it helps you avoid unwanted solicitation.

Like someone said, give yourself plenty of time to get somewhere, as there are always delays.

If you do have a therapist, I would highly suggest bringing this up to them. If you don't, just take it easy and take it one step at a time.",1
"When I moved from my small town where you literally had to call the one bus service for a ride to a city with actual busses, I panicked. Given, this was also over a decade ago, so Google maps was worse.  I messed up one day, and you know what happened? Nothing alarming! I road the bus around the wrong end of it's route after getting on the wrong way, got a slight snicker from the bus driver when we stopped at the station for his shift break and I said I needed to go back the other way, and that's it! If you're going anywhere where timing is crucial, make sure to plan a bit of time padding (I like Google maps, but they definitely plan for everything to run exactly on their calculated times), and don't panic!",1
"Spend a few days planning out your route for school, for work, for home, for the grocery store. Will you be utilizing the bus, the train, walking, biking, or a combination. Then you take it and you make mental or literal notes about the steps you’d need to take. I’d utilize either the cta map, google or a third party app to give me the directions, but I’d use key markers to notate where and how. 

For instance, I’d need to take the redline from north/halsted. The entrance for the train is directly across from the Apple Store on the southern side of halsted, once I’ve entered and swiped or tapped to pay, I’d proceed down the flight of stairs. I’d make note of what’s the south destination and north destination. I know that 95th/dan Ryan is south and Howard is north. I’m going to the loop, the loop is south of me, so I’d continue to follow the directions for the southbound platform. Etc etc but I’d outline 

Step 1: find entrance
Step 2: head to southbound platform 
Step 3: exit at train stop I need 
Step 4: so on and so on. 

The nuances will come later, for instance you’ll learn which train stops have multiple entrances/exits, where you can connect to other trains, and so forth. If you mess up and confuse yourself, just stop and center yourself look at your directions again and try it out again. If you still can grasp ask someone. The platform attendant, the bus driver, the random person on the street, most likely someone will help to the best of their ability",1
Try taking short trips on it first.,0
Short time and you’ll be riding like a native! No better education than  that obtained by experience,1
"Do you have a friend that can come with you for a trial run? I don’t know how severe your anxiety is, but I have been that CTA savvy friend for coworkers before, and I have always been happy to do it. Getting good at using public transport can feel very freeing. 

Keep stoic and just follow common sense rules of etiquette. Politely decline if anyone starts harassing you, and remember that the bus drivers and workers are actually very helpful. Most I’ve seen are happy to go out of their way to help newbies/tourists. 

Jokey side note, try not to talk too much on the morning commute. It gives the newbies away (in a cute way).",1
By riding! Exposure therapy will work wonders.,0
"Same way you get through all anxiety, push through it until it gets easier.",1
You just use it. You get used to it.,0
"Last night I was kinda drunk and not paying any attention so I got on the blue line heading north instead of south. I realized immediately and just got off at the next stop, crossed to the other platform, and got on a train heading home after waiting for a few minutes. Making mistakes sometimes happens to us all but it’s super easy to fix! Just get off at the next stop and you’ll be fine. You can never really get lost these days with google maps.",1
"For the train it'll help if you know the end station that is the direction you want to head in. For example, if i'm downtown and i want to go to Milwaukee/Damen on the blue line, I want to get on a blue line train to O'Hare. 

You'll get the hang of it quickly.",1
Remember that even those of us who have been doing it for a decade or more sometimes fuck it up.,0
"I started taking public transit by myself when I was around 14 bc I had to start commuting to high school. I was in summer school and my dad met me at school and took the whole route home with me. It helped a lot to go through the route with someone who was familiar with the way the el and buses operate and it made me a lot less nervous when buying my train card and swiping it to get on the platform. If you have a friend or family member from here who uses public transit a lot, ask them to go with you the first few times you use  it and go somewhere fun to take the pressure off. 

Also if you ever feel uneasy, sit in the first car. I always felt safer when I was near the conductor.",1
It will only take you a short time to get used to it and before you know it you’ll know how to get anywhere on the CTA.,0
I wanna move Chicago soon,0
"Tons of great advice already, but just wanted to add that I also had a lot of anxiety about public transport when I moved here from a small town a year ago, so feel free to reach out if you’re ever feeling overwhelmed!!",1
"Good reminder that weird doesn't mean dangerous. Be aware of your surroundings for sure, and take reasonable safety precautions, but most things people get worked up about are pretty harmless.",1
The apps are great. I use Moovit and I love it. Really plots out my course and offers other ways to get there.,1
"The el stop named Chicago is named for the street, not the city. You got this.",0
"Tips:

- don't leave your wallet/phone in your back pocket

- remember what the stop is before your stop so you're aware when to get off

- compass on your phone helps 

- if a train is empty, do not go in",1
"When I have to go to Chicago, I've found public transportation to be much easier. I've driven a few times, but it's not worth the hassle, even when my parking is validated.

I'll use Google Maps to plan the route I need to take.  Usually Google Maps provides many different options.  Sometimes it suggests the train or the bus.  I always will make sure my Ventra card has enough money.  I also will look up the route for returning, since it could be a different bus or train. 

The first time I took the bus, I was a little nervous, but now I feel more comfortable.",1
"I’m about to move there this summer and am a little nervous learning a whole new, way larger system (i am from Boston) but wanted to chime in because newcomers from all over never know they have to push the stop request button on our green line trolleys when they were outside (underground they stop at all stops) so they learn the hard way on certain lines that go to the immediate suburbs (newton/ chestnut hill) because the stops are far apart. :)

You’ll get there!",1
I visit Chicagoland frequently and have never had an issue with the public transportation.,0
"I was once told that the trains and buses are meant to cater to the lowest common denominator- you are almost definitely not the dumbest person to be riding the train at any given point in time, and if all these other people can manage it, so can you. It’s also really forgiving! If you go the wrong direction or go a stop too far, you can always get on the next train going the opposite direction.",1
"Lots of great advice on public transit, in addition, I’ve found the article below and being aware of how the grid works to be very helpful in helping myself get oriented wherever I am in the city, whether transit, on foot, or driving

https://chicagostudies.uchicago.edu/grid",1
I like to go hiking.,1
Review instructions/videos online of how to ride and pay for fare. And then practice using transit when you don’t need to be anywhere at a specific time so you don’t feel rushed or stressed and it’s ok if you make a mistake. Use apps like Transit or Google Maps for real time tracking and steps.,1
"Hi! I get easily overwhelmed when trying to take public transit, so I just throw in my AirPods and listen to either some confident/pump up music or some calming music to drown out all the noise around me. That usually helps me focus on getting where I need to go without being anxious about a billion other aspects of public transit!",1
"Hi! I'm also a transplant from a small town! I've been taking the train and bus since I moved almost two years ago and it's honestly not that daunting.

I recommend riding the train more often first as I think it's easier (only north and south as another commenter mentioned) and you don't have to request your stop. The bus is also pretty easy but you have to pay closer attention. Utilize google maps, the Ventra app and in your early days try to sight see and get around the city exclusively through the CTA.

You'll be just fine and will love the CTA in no time!",1
"Do it a hundred times, your anxiety will be replaced by boredom and irritation. 

I used to be terrified of strangers, now I just ignore them, or they annoy me, or occasionally they make me laugh. 

In my 10 years of commuting, I have been actually afraid maybe 5 times.

Take right now, there is a dude 5 feet away from me, rolling around on the floor of the train and yelling. I can tell he's going though some kind of crisis, and probably would be dangerous if I tried to interact with him, but for now I just wish he would fuck off, and that's it.

Update: in the time it took me to type this, he fucked off to another car. Hurray!",1
Don’t be afraid to ask people for help if you’re confused. People are generally really friendly here and happy to assist,1
Ventra app and CTA train tracker have accurate arrival times.,0
Stick to trains first if you can help it.,1
"I first moved here as a student at SAIC. I moved  from a small town too! I started getting comfortable riding the train just a few stops in either direction and exploring that area, then going back home via train. I repeated this on several different trains until I felt more confident riding further away from 'home'. Back then I thought River North was WORLDS away from the Loop where I lived in dorms :) Also I eventually started meeting friends who lived farther out in the neighborhoods and that was encouragement to explore more and feel confident that a 'familiar face' was waiting for me at the other end of the train. ",1
I got over it because I have no other choice unless I want to take Ubers everywhere,1
"City mapper, google maps, Apple Maps. They all are a little different in their UI, reliability, etc. Find out what works best for you and know when to use each. For example, living in Boston, I always open Citymapper to find when the next train is coming, because Apple Maps doesn’t update as quickly and usually isn’t as accurate. But if I’m just walking the city, Apple Maps is my favorite to use because it’s the least confusing",1
"Part of my job involves helping people navigate public transit and making it more accessible to all. I am happy to meet you in public and help you learn how to beat navigate the transit system if meeting someone in person would help you. Otherwise, lots of great tips in the thread. And I recommend Transit app, that's what I train seniors (65+) on.",1
Until I grew more familiar and comfortable with certain lines or buses I have the exact path I am going to travel pulled up with Google Maps. Then I just check in on that map to make sure I’m going in the planned direction,1
"Utilize the Google Maps transit option. I’ve lived here my whole life but if I’m ever unsure of when I am, simply checking the transit option makes me feel much more secure about what my options are rather than guessing my way home.",1
"When I was getting oriented, I would always start by looking for the posted list of stops while I'm waiting for the bus or train. I would confirm that the stop I'm going to is on the list in the correct direction. Then when I get on the bus or train I would do the same thing, look for a list of stops and confirm I'm moving the right direction towards the stop that I need. Like others have said, note the stop before the one you need to get off so you hear it announced in time to be ready.",1
"I would say that most people are probably “nicer than they look”.  Meaning - most people on transit  are likely on their phones, earbuds in, or reading etc., and may not seem very approachable in the moment. But, a lot of us are more than willing to answer a question or help out if somebody is lost! 😀",1
"The more you try it, the easier it gets. Regardless, keeping your awareness is key for being a kind rider and also for your safety. Big fan of getting on the first train car—it’s near the driver and usually a bit less crowded, since it isn’t right in front of the platform entrance.",1
You can always find someone happy to help point you the right direction.,1
It’s a lot easier than the bus I’ll tell you that,1
"Speaking for myself, the way I dealt with it was to just keep taking it, day in and day out.  I came to Chicago growing up in a town of 1200 people. After a while it becomes routine, where you can still stay alert, but do tasks on your phone and/or read.  Nobody really cares about you or what you're doing. 

There isn't a whole lot to ""navigate"" in Chicago with regard to the L trains.  It's not a complex system like the subways in New York or the Underground in London, where a map is really needed even if you're pretty familiar.  With Chicago you need a map to start with but after awhile you'll get the hang of the lines you use regularly and won't really need a map anymore. As I was getting familiar with things I'd sometimes take either the red or the brown line to my work downtown - it was fun getting both the above ground and the below ground perspectives.  Now I'm all about speed so just take the red line unless there are problems.

Most people using public transit in Chicago are heading to or from Downtown; that's why the announcements and the signs refer to ""inbound"" (toward downtown) or ""outbound"" (from downtown) trains.  

You can always get off a train and either wait for another train either going the same direction or moving the other direction.  If I ever feel uncomfortable on a train or if I miss my stop that is what I do.

The other thing I would do when I was getting familiar with things was I would take the different lines over the weekends.  So like I'd take the blue line to O'Hare and the Orange Line to Midway and explore the area around the airports.  Then I took the brown line, the purple line and the yellow line and explored the neighborhoods in those lines.  There is a series of PBS episodes called ""Chicago by L"" that provide interesting neighborhood explorations if this will help curb some of your anxiety.  Exploring the city is a truly fun thing to do during the weekends when the weather is nice.",1
"Google maps usually always tells you what to do. The arrival times aren't correct tho, you'll have to use CTA train tracker. Always look at the signs and make sure you're at 1.the right stop. 2. The right line 3. The right direction. For example. 1 Chicago and Franklin 2. Brown Line 3. To Kimball. It's the same for the bus. Look at the bus stop and it will tell you the name of the bus (66) and the direction (to Austin). 

I moved from a super small town and had very little experience with public transit and I initially took many wrong busses and trains. Usually I would realize it by the first few stops and I didn't end up too lost. I was so inexperienced I actually didn't even understand how to use the stop request cord on the bus - I thought the bus would automatically stop at every stop and I didn't have to tell the driver to do it. 

I would say after about a month I was fairly comfortable with riding public transit, but I also rode it frequently all around the city.",1
"I think I’ve read all of these suggestions and no one has said anything I had in mind 😆 as a single woman in Chicago, there are a few things I thought were helpful to learn early on:
- all cities have dangerous and creepy people who use public transportation so if you’re going to wear headphones, keep the volume v low or don’t have anything playing the first handful of times so you can hear the train or bus alerts for where the next stop is; there are also digital signs on most train cars that will show the next stop, and the bus always has that at the front by the driver
- the CTA and pace buses use a pull wire to indicate when you want to get off: you have to pull the wire when your stop is announced or they won’t know to stop (esp if no one else is getting off)
- pace buses are more so for the suburbs so you likely won’t need to use them, but it’s nice to know the difference so you don’t get on the wrong bus
- the CTA red line train (in Chicago we call it the el) goes north to south for most of the city’s length; the blue line goes east to west - these are the two most commonly used el lines, but all lines start and/or transfer from the Loop which is downtown Chicago
- the Metra train is NOT a CTA train: similar to pace buses, metra is a convenient way to get to/from the suburbs for folx who commute to work (or want to get from the south side to north side faster)
- on a busy train car and bus, always get up a stop or two early to wait to exit: you might get caught in the midst of other commuters before making it off if you’re not prepared, esp on the el
- the el is based of color lines, the buses are all numbered
- download the Ventra app so you can avoid losing your fare card; you can add it to your digital wallet as well",1
"Go out waaaay before you need to arrive, and if you miss something you have time to correct. Eventually you’ll know your stops. Won’t change the fact that you’ll also eventually miss them because of your phone or something. 

But basically don’t do your first navigations of a new-to-you route with a tight deadline.",1
"You aren't trapped in there with them, they are trapped in there with you",1
"Make sure not to wear shoes in your house, cuz likely somewhere on public transportation, you were standing in urine.",1
Just time and iterations. Realize that many have done it and do it. It becomes second nature.,0
"Chicago is a grid. The East numbers are odd and West are even. If you know the address you can picture where it is on the map. Knowing this you will get a feeling how far it is from you and how long it takes to get there. I'm a farm boy too. 40 years ago. Oh man, I've been here a while. I still put ketchup on my hotdogs. [Only at home]",1
"I would suggest asking a friend that you can go with so you can both try together. The CTA bus drivers and transit workers are very helpful and want to assist you if you ask, don be afraid to ask questions, they want to get you where you’re going. Also I say this as someone who stutters and has anxiety lol",1
If you have to ride the redline or god forbid go south of Roosevelt make sure you have a loaded gun and be ready to shoot,1
Using google or apple maps to help navigate the trains or busses helps so much! Tells you what stop to get on and off at very clearly.,1
I would suggest not wearing headphones.,0
"Ok, so I didn’t move here from a small town but I did move here from the suburbs and had a substantial amount of social anxiety upon moving here. Some of my anxiety was from driving in general, so that was automatically relieved by selling my car and relying solely on transit, biking, and my own two feet.

1. I got this handy app called Transit. It’s a lifesaver and it’s a lot more reliable than Google Maps. It helps me feel confident about where I’m going, when I’ll get there, and how I’ll get back home.

2. Wearing headphones! Listening to a podcast, audiobook, or some music while on the train or bus is my favorite pastime. It also helps me tune out loud noises and disruptive conversations.

3. Take the same train or bus a couple times in the same week, for commuting to work or for no reason at all. Once I have my familiar routes, I have a lot less anxiety while traveling because I know where the stops are, what neighborhoods they go to, how much traffic they might get stuck in depending on the time.

You’ve got this!",1
It will be like clockwork before you know it. CTA apps help with timing...,1
"If you find yourself riding Metra trains you will quickly find your anxiety easing. It's a safe laid back experience. I was at witts end with driving too and from work. The sheer stupidity and pure ignorance on the roads and highways on the daly commute started affecting me hours after I got home. Now I sit on the train and read or play games on my phone instead of getting pissed at the world.
The most important thing with trains is stay out of there way. Never underestimate how unforgiving all that steel is.",1
Use the CityMapper app to tell you where and how to go through the transfers. It’s a step by step guide you can set from anywhere in the city and the data is updated in real time.,0
Practice and preparation,0
"Download the Ventra app, it gives you real time updates on train locations and step by step directions to get pretty much anywhere in the city. (What train/bus you should be on, what stops to get on and off at, how far away the next train or bus is)

99% of the people on the train just want to be left alone and quietly get to their destination. It’s totally fine to wear a hat and face mask and mind your own business if you are feeling anxious.",1
Walk with conviction like you have somewhere to get to (you probably do!) as opposed to aimlessly wandering around.,1
"Google maps is the best way. Ive lived here 10+ years and still use it constantly to navigate busses and routes i dont take frequently. 

Just put your destination in, select public transit as an option and start your route. Itll even buzz your phone or play a notification over your headphones when your stop is approaching.",1
"Google maps and transit maps on the CTA help a lot.

No different than taking public transportation in any city around the world.",1
"One thing I did when I first moved here, wear headphones and have your Google maps on!  This way you can hear directions as you travel.  I used it more for walking purposes but let google maps be your friend ❤",1
Ride it more often and the anxiety will go away. Anxiety does not go away by itself you have to push it out with experience.,0
I lived in the Chicago area for 40 years and once you can get a hold of a CTA map to start you should be ok as I wouldn't expect you to know the area like still do but know in due time you'll know the Chicago area like a champ,1
"Using it a lot. Like biking on busy streets, it can take some adjustment.",1
"I just kept doing it until I wasn't nervous about it anymore. I've made a few mistakes and gotten on the wrong train or bus, and then it turned out that wasn't quite so horrible as I thought it might be. And the CTA drivers are all really nice in my experience, and happy to help point you in the right direction.",1
"Just do it? Fuck people are weak sauce these days.

Anxiety is a side effect of being outside your comfort zone.  Being outside side your comfort zone means you are learning and growing.  The more you do something the less anxiety will occur.  Go do it, make mistakes, rinse and repeat.  Asking other Redditors how to manage feelings will only delay the growth.

Fun fact: this is a life pro tip, not just a CTA exclusive fix",1
Just walk up and punch the biggest guy you see on the train in the mouth.,0
I got a girlfriend the first year I moved here that taught me everything.,0
"As someone who did just what you said… I didn’t get over the anxiety😂

I lived in Chicago for two years and I don’t think I used public transportation once. Given, I had the privilege of having a car and a parking space, so if I was going somewhere I usually either walked or drove.",1
"From someone who takes the late night red line regularly, practice using those emergency doors between cars when the train is in motion so that you are prepared if you ever have to do it for real.

And be willing to change cars as soon as your hackles go up.",1
"I’m a daily Blue Line rider, and I had a moment where I wondered whether I should feel more uneasy. Starting from the baseline that what happened is horrific and our transit system should be safer, this is subjectively where I’ve landed:

- This incident could have just as easily happened on a sidewalk, there’s nothing about it that was inherent to transit 
- Part of the reality of living in densely populated areas means you are rubbing shoulders with people capable of terrible things, and 99.9% of the time you will never know
- As part of the broken society we are living in now where people who are unwell have far too easy access to weapons, should I feel more or less safe on the train than any other public space anymore?
- When I hear about a road rage incident where someone kills another driver over the most menial ‘offense,’ does it make me question driving to the same degree?
- Was this targeted hatred towards people experiencing homelessness? If yes, I’m far less vulnerable than people who are already extremely socially vulnerable. Does this tragedy make me more concerned for the risks these people are exposed to that I’m not?

As I’ve chewed over these thoughts, I’m more inclined to just live as normal. It’s definitely a wake up call moment and we need to take serious steps to making the CTA safer and wider conversation around providing safe spaces for unhoused people, but I’ve ultimately decided that basic street smarts still apply both on the train and any other public space.

It’s a really messed up reality to even have to think about how to respond to reports of a mass shooting at all, day in, day out, in every sort of public space imaginable by now.",1
Practice situational awareness. Stay away from sketchy people. Ride with a friend or avoid being in a train car solo. Carry pepper spray and stay in shape.,1
"What I do and recommend for you is this:
Take the first available bus or train so you don't have to wait too long. 
Try to be in one of the first train cars.
Always be aware of your surroundings. Don't wear both headphones at the same time.
If someone asks for change or food, politely apologize and say you have nothing to give, then return to whatever you were doing. Avoid giving them further attention, including eye contact, and don't engage in conversation. They will eventually walk away.
If you visit luxury brand stores, try to get a discreet shopping bag.
If you ever feel unsafe, get off at the next stop and call the police.",1
"Monday was a loose cannon shooting sleeping homeless people, I don't think that's a sign of what will happen to you",0
My rule of thumb is 100% keeping to myself. And I ride the red line after dark many times.,0
"This goes back on Dorval Carter and the degradation of service.  It was safer prior with way more trains and buses.  He tanked service and that tanked ridership.  We were always safer in the numbers of normal riders vs theft, muggins and mentally ill people.",1
"So many people just saying be vigilant of x y and z and you'll be fine as if there's anywhere to go when a crazy dude with nothing to lose crosses from car to car mid transit.  Maybe instead of adapting to criminals, we should remove them?",1
"As a woman, I'm always trying to be aware of my surroundings so I almost never have headphones in (unless I just can't take hearing someone else blasting music from their phones) and I try to ride in the front car so at least the conductor is right there.",0
"DO NOT make eye contact with heightened people. 

I took the redline to 95th recently and I was stunned when a young person gave eye contact to a ranting and raving rider. He got even more agitated and loud.

You are far more likely to die in a car accident in Chicago than to be killed on a CTA train.,0

"Glad you mention Roosevelt, my nearest subway station. I'm all for a security team providing support when police officers are rarely able to be present, but I rarely actually see how they are helping. I like to see them on the platform, but often times there's a group discussion going on at the top of the escalator... where I rarely see any problems. 

On another note though, I get a chance to visit several of the subway stations and Roosevelt subway platform is by far the dirtiest. It could use a mopping or something... daily!",1
Saw these dudes roll up to the Fullerton stop once. Half of them were on their phones and the other half were just dicking around. Super clear they don’t take the job seriously and as a result no one takes them seriously either,1
I once saw security (of some kind) put an aggressive homeless guy ONTO the blue line. Wild.,1
those dogs don’t even seem trained fr. every time i walk through roosevelt one is going crazy non-stop barking and its lowkey terrifying,0
Call your alderman,0
Not fair to say they do nothing. I once witnessed a security guard tell some guys to move their drug deal to the private end of the train car.,0
"INTER-CON is worse imo. At least K-9 dresses the part and look some what intimidating, besides they stay on the property. Inter con security folks are always on their phones,  walking of the property and doing nothing. I know because I work for CTA. 

We need an actual police force. CPD don't do anything. The Transit Detail from CPD is overtime for the cops, and boy do they act like it. They're just about as bad as the security folks.",1
They're not so much a show of force to deter criminal behavior as they are security theater to make residents feel like something is being done about crime. The whole thing is a pathetic joke and a waste of money.,1

They're there to flirt with the female CTA employees that wear the reflective safety vests and are the loudest on the trains. It's like watching a satirical crime movie.,1
"Security guards are useless in general. Low barrier of entry and effectiveness, so you get a bunch of lazy people who just want a paycheck rather than an actual safer city. They aren’t stopping any threats, let alone even trying. 

Need actual cops on the platforms and trains.

Edit: The person who shot 4 people on the blue line the other day worked as a security guard, so it shows you the type of people the “profession” brings. These people are affiliated with the trouble we want to stop off hours.",1
are the dogs suppose to detect guns? cus i’ve definitely seen people walk by strapped and get no reaction. also seen so many of these k9 people kicking and in general mistreating these poor pups.,1
"I wrote my Alderman about this (46th ward) and didn’t get a response, not surprising.  Probably need to circulate a petition to several sympathetic city council members, maybe get some animal rights orgs on board.  The action k9 thing is transparently a giant waste of money, way more than the shotspotter contract, the animals are mistreated, and the whole thing reeks of a corrupt handout.",1
Are those dogs actual service dogs? I've noticed a high degree of reactivity from them,0
I came to visit twice and I didn’t understand why they were there. They just deterred us from going downstairs on the blue line whilst arguing with a patron. I eventually just pushed through them bc I had a train to catch but why???? I’m an outsider looking in but I don’t see the purpose.,0
"As some one who has worked for them, it’s an awful company. Y’all don’t like us, the gang members don’t like us, and we even get shit from management. So, at a certain point, some will stop caring about the job. However, there are some in the company who will absolutely do the job well. There are some great men and women in that position. 

However, CTA is a big contract and it felt like the company was constantly trying to keep their head above water while trying to meet demands. By the way, contract just got renewed a little while ago and CTA is a private company with some government funding. 

The dogs are kept in okay conditions. Far from the a life of luxury a dog at home sees but they get fresh water, food, and a place to sleep. And the actual trainer is clearly loving toward them. 

The clients pay for a person with a dog so they value their dogs, but some handlers don’t even like dogs. If you see someone mistreating dogs, I would report it to CTA or directly to Action K9. I hated seeing people mistreating dogs, so absolutely report them. 

What action k9 is a best option for people that have no where else to go for now. Some just want experience so they can go to law enforcement, some feel lucky to have a job that pays $25/hr and do their best to keep it, and some happened to get hired and put minimal effort into everything. They have awful benefits so that $25 is getting stretched into everything. 


Personally, I left because of the poor work life balance. During DNC, they told us to be prepared to work for 6 days straight. I was fine with that. The Monday of that week, they told us we’d be working the whole week with no days off, so some of us went two weeks straight with no day off. It’s also a very toxic work environment. Everyone thinks they’re the big dog and everyone is talking shit about someone. It’s a big high school, essentially. They then had me sign a paper to get my final check after they tried to pressure me to pay for training that they claimed to cover. But because they weren’t playing by the law, pretty sure that signature settled things.",1
Wah wah wah more whining by people who don’t contribute shit positively to this city. Stfu it’s easy to complain behind a screen. ,1

Everyone needs to vent sometimes. Here's a few resources to help you with the next steps:

1. Contact the CTA directly via their [feedback page](https://www.transitchicago.com/feedback/). Copy/Paste your post to save time. 


2. Find your Alderperson by entering your address [here](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/mayor/iframe/lookup_ward_and_alderman.html). Email their office or meet in person to share your experience. Many offer a weekly ""ward night"" for constituents. This usually  is one on one. 


3. Consider joining activist groups like [Commuter's Take Action](https://www.ctaction.org/) or [Better Streets Chicago](https://www.betterstreetschicago.org/)


4. Sign up for CTA delay alerts [here](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/ILCTA/subscriber/new). Customize based on your chosen Bus or L line. Elevator outages alerts are also an option.

I feel *extra* safe with the K9 security blocking the accessible gate at my station every afternoon. All of my problems with the CTA have been solved! /s,1
There is security staff?! I’ve been up and down the Red Line all week and haven’t seen anyone? Am I missing something?,1
"I know it’s not the same as texting, but the cta site does have a chat box that lets you report issues. It doesn’t ask for your name/info but I don’t know if it captures your IP address so i can’t say for sure if it’s really anonymous. 

I’ve used it twice so far. Once to report a smoker (nothing happened), once to report broken AC (it started working 5-10 minutes after I reported it).",1
Seriously!!! They act like hitting the call operator button is a safe option.,1
"I've used the chatbot to report smokers 3 times, and 2 of those times within 5 minuted the train stopped and the operator kicked the POS off.",0
"&gt; In all seriousness: $71 million can easily fund a dispatch center, staff, and transit police (at targeted/select stations) to protect the general public.

CTA doesn't disagree with you but general police powers were removed from them when the RTA was formed in the 1980s (hence why CTA's police ceased to exist at that time). CTA only has the authority to have **conductors** enforce CTA ordinances under state law. Carter asked the General Assembly in 2019 to give CTA police powers back, but the General Assembly did not pick up the issue nor has it made its way into the MMA proposal that is currently being killed by state senators who don't understand what the point of it is if it isn't going to fix anything.

So just to be clear, CTA ""security"" are part of the PR budget and were hired to improve quarterly survey results.

As for hitting the call button or calling 911 being your only options, blame the state. Ohio, which is run by anti-government nutjobs, got their shit together almost two full decades ago now and mandated statewide text-to-911. Illinois left it up to every individual dispatch center and CPD/OEMC have not deemed it a priority to implement.",1

Why has this contract not been canceled?  There's no way they can be upholding their end unless - unless now hear me out - that the city drafted a really bad contract.  I know it's far-fetched but maybe.  Or maybe no one in city gov't is paying attention or gives a shit what they do with our money.,0
They really seem to just be security theater as you said at least from what I have seen,1
The contract is for 250 mil. How many real cops or conductors could be had for that price?,0
"There is absolutely none.  Was a last ditch effort to make the cta look better before the election and consequently line someone's pocket before she left.  

They are a disgrace everyday

Add: it's not their fault they have 0 training and 0 authority but still the attitude and 0 professionalism is shocking sometimes.  I mean all the time",1
Jobs program - give cushy low skill jobs to provide ineffective security theater.,1
"I was exiting the Lake Street station the other day and two of the security guards were having a conversation at the turnstiles.. as I was coming out, two women jumped the turnstiles.. the two security guards looked at them, looked at each other, then proceeded to continue their conversation.. I just smirked and went on up to street level.. smh..",1
"Got a “hey, beautiful” and then a “You too good for me?” when I didn’t respond to one of them outside of the Kedzie Green Line stop a few months ago. 

He wasn’t at the stop itself, so might have been on break or something. I didn’t feel unsafe, just annoyed, but the whole thing felt counterproductive.",1
Oh lord. The Security crew with their dogs at Belmont. They are indeed a bizarre bunch of folks for sure as in they literally do nothing. Genuinely nothing. As others have said they are just stood at the turnstiles with a dig for some reason. I mean…the dog isn’t doing much if there’s people smoking weed twenty feet above you on the platform. It’s a charade and how they employ these folks is beyond me. Never seen so many people absolutely love bags of chips and charging their phones and doing nothing.,1
Yeah they are for looks only. They re at Jackson all the time in a giant group and then completely ignore 100% of any situation. They barely even look. I don’t expect some 50 year old lady to confront some crazy dude popping off - but maybe they could radio someone perhaps? Maybe do literally anything? 😂,1
"Did you report this to the cta?

I work with the cta a lot and not enough people report this at the station (where something can be done) or on the website (so it can be logged as a problem and get the attention it deserves)

This also hurts the alders when they try to follow up about issues. You should report it to the cta at both the station and the website.",0
Truly a “check the box” exercise.  I also don’t understand the point of large groups of them together. Shouldn’t they spread out across the system?,1
"A few days ago I was on the blue line when a woman was acting extremely paranoid and was barring people from sitting adjacent to her. The security contractors (~4 or 5) stepped in and handled the issue and no other problems for the rest of the ride. 

Small anecdote but it was positive for me I suppose.",1
"I'm surprised they are even at Garfield stop. Most of these seem to congregate outside of the loop stations which are a bit quite(incidents wise) and are not cooped inside. For the last few months, Addison, Irving Park, and Rosemont stations on Blue line seem to be their favorites. Back in June, there was a weekday where I counted 14 of them on the Irving Park platform, at 4pm.",1
"OP, I straight up witnessed a man try to steal from another sleeping (homeless) man. Told them he was still on the train and may try to do it to others. They looked at each other, said “oh yeah, that’s the guy that was talking to us…” and laughed it off, in my face.

That, and the time I watched ~10 CTA security surround and force a homeless man off the seats (this was, of course, at Addison after a Cubs game), when he was bothering no one. They just got off at the next stop and presumably continued to waste money and time.

It’s 100% theater for suburbanites, IMO. Same thing with the K-9 units, only time I’ve seen them in action is harassing someone at the Grand Red Line station.",1
Their primary purpose is deterrence; the theory is that if people see a uniformed security guard they'll be less likely to do any criming.,1
"Maybe you're not wrong,...but I have to call out your unarmed thing. You know over penetration is a thing right?

Sure, you might think having an armed presence on the train would project threat to stop criminals, but have you considered how likely an over-penetration that hits an innocent bystander would be in the close quarters of a train?

It's a public safety (and legal) nightmare, and then consider, if someone is planning to \*light up\* a train, I don't think one armed security officer is going to dissuade them.

I don't think arming them has benefits that outweigh the risks. They are bouncers. They can project as an authority figure to keep drunken riffraff down, but they aren't going to be a hero.  


Shootings ""on a train"" are a statistically incredibly rare thing, in particular because of what a long shot you have of escaping a moving train, the close quarters, ect.   


Shooting on a train is just a bad idea on multiple levels.",1
"I was at the Cermak Chinatown stop and they were all clustered at one end of the station away from most of the passengers, then a homeless guy started yelling and being erratic near them, and next thing I know they're gone at the other end of the station.

Actively avoiding security threats and leaving citizens to fend for themselves.",1
lmao because cops don’t do anything especially not fake cops like mall cops and whatever you called these guys,1
Don't worry had a seizure on the blue line yest7rday in the morning I asked a gentleman if I could plz sit I was feeling super sick.. i got a flat put no... i have a backpack which says med on it as a medical alert bag.. multiple people saw me sit on the floor and did nothing!!! a let's just say my body told me to sit and ended up sitting on the train floor. I don't remember Logan square to harlem work at 12 hr shift sick a hell.,1
CPD deserves a lot of criticism but between the peacekeepers and CTA security the thought that there’s better options has not been proven. CPD deserves more respect. It’s a hard job and we haven’t found a better option. Hold the bad officers accountable but the good ones deserve a lot more respect,1
"Idk but crime on cta is down double digits this year from last... not saying it is due to them but, maybe its working more than people think",0
I believe they are supposed to be a deterrent and they can take it upon themselves to resolve a matter verbally (in the cases where they actually do their job) or simply call those guys with the blue shirts with the black vest thingies that we collectively as a society want to defund,1
"Y’all whine about them but I used to take the blue line everyday, and even if it is security theater, just having someone present dissuades crime. It’s easier to commit a crime when you believe you can get away with it.",1
"
“I get why they were brought in, to try to curb crime and violence on the system “

“They honestly feel like security theater for suburbanites who think everyone who rides the cta gets robbed.”",1
"I don’t know which trains you take but they are full with people smoking weed, playing loud musics from their speakers snd just shouting.

The number of crazy persons in CTA surpasses anything I’ve seen on other metros. 

My opinion those above people are what they are supposed to help with. And they should.

This thread feels like:
“There is no war in Ba Sing se”",1
Even if it’s theatre maybe it’s good. People are likely to commit less crime if someone with an security vest is around,1
Take pics and report them.,0
Wish they’d wear superhero costumes…,1
"Considering I was riding the brown line and 4 of these security guards were aboard, talking to each other while 3 teenagers smoked (I think they were Dabs) with the windows open in the same car tells me what kind of ""security"" CTA hired.",1
So mayor can say they did something and contactors get the jerbs,0
"Video them, post on social media,  news outlets....",0
"We have “security” at our place of employment. If a gun fight happened in front of them they’d be oblivious and defenseless. With that said, we are told they are there to create a sense of safety and deter criminals.",1
They're not cops. I still see them every day on the red line. They are almost entirely useless.,0
"Those security people have no power to make arrests, they are just there to give the implication that there is safety... I do this kind of security for a living and I have no actual power to stop anyone...and by the time I call 911, they are gone..",1
"I saw one of those ""officers"" yelling at her dog and yanking the leash. At first I thought it was a parent screaming at their child, when I got closer and saw it was a grown ass woman yelling at a dog. From what I saw the dog wasn't doing anything wrong. It wasn't barking or acting out. The dog looked sad. Fuck those people.",1
lol they fired they ain’t do shit them dogs used to be sleeping always and them dudes taught they was hot shit people still get jacked up robbed etc,1
I once heard someone compare those K-9 units as “Michael vicks wannabe/hasbeen” and I’m checking to see if any of you heard such comparisons?,0
"Honestly not sure either lol I see them once a while but only in the loop, I take orange line and I’ve only seen K9’s in loop stops, last time I saw one was at Harold Washington library sometime in early December but it was late at night so it made sense for “security” to be there",1
"It seems like they're only there to get rid of the homeless at the end of the line, and used to intimidate people that don't recognize the dog has a cage on its face and really can't do much. 
    A lesser amount of actual security officers with authority to arrest and detain and write tickets would be a hell of a lot more useful.",1
Saw a bunch at the Orange Line Rosevelt Station on Friday. They were inside just talking amongst themselves so I imagine it was break time.,0
"They around, they keep telling me to put my weed out lol",1
"Instead of paying actual cops who are able to enforce laws and make arrests, someone in charge had a friend who happened to own a security company.  ",1
Placebo effect. Entirely useless,0
I just wish we had actual CTA police like the MTA does… I really wish we could get our thoughts out to the visible public so something can get down. It seems our current leaders do not gaf at all,1

"They have absolutely no power what so ever, if they ask you to stop you can just walk right past them.. they can't touch or detain you.. They are their to give the illusion of safety.. I do this kind of security for special events... All I can do is yell, then get on my radio and report it to my supervisor or call 911... The police do not take these kinds of calls seriously and by the time they arrive everything will be done and over.. I just got off the #3 going south and there was a smoker who was blasting his bluetooth speaker... There were several people who complained and the driver did absolutely nothing... Just stay off the CTA if you can and just drive to work.. This also applies to the trains too.. I go to Transitchicago.com and make a complaint but again nothing gets done...",1

We need to stop referring to them as security.. they are wasters... waste of time and money,0
"These guys are security theatre. I saw a knife fight at the Jackson red line stop platform and the 8 or so ‘security’ were the first ones to run away. Luckily no one was actually stabbed, just circling and knife waving. I saw the same guy who pulled the knife a few weeks later openly selling drugs and the ‘security’ was watching and laughing. 

Are they even allowed to do anything?",1
How long have you lived here? Sounds pretty regular degular to me lmao,1
"I actually saw some of these dudes make a guy put out his ciq on the platform recently, though the vibe was definitely 'we can't smoke down here, so fuck you, you can't either.'

Progress I guess?",1
"NYC trains are generally much safer than the CTA. A lot of smoking and peddling. Brown line is the safest, red line the worst. you should be generally fine during the day and rush hour but if you have PTSD from prior incidents stick with NYC.",1
"For the CTA it really depends on which line and station. 

If you’re looking at Logan Square or Wicker Park, you’d likely be using the Blue Line most often. From my experience, it’s not the best, not the worst. 

It is one of the two 24/7 lines and is mostly underground, so you do get some not great experiences. Also, take this how you will, but Logan and Wicker are both pretty “hip” and young areas. So you’ll likely see a lot more drunk people. Not necessarily a bad thing, but can make things more interesting. 

As some others have said, from my experience, the Brown Line is the least chaotic, so if you decide to look more towards the north side, keep that in mind. 

The walk will vary a lot on your neighborhood. Logan Square can be a bit sketchy depending on which part. Some of Logan Square has some amazing restaurants and bars, some parts a little less so. Nothing too crazy, just more vacant storefronts. Wicker Park is more “established” but has seen an increase in crime recently. 

As some others have mentioned too, actual violent crime on the CTA is fairly rare. But it does seem like there are more uncomfortable experiences on the CTA vs NYC subway. Smoking, drugs, drinking, general rowdiness, etc. 

Overall, NYC is probably “safer” but I wouldn’t consider the CTA “unsafe”. 

Also worth noting, I almost never take the train in Chicago. I take the bus much more frequently and it is much less sketchy from my experience.",1
"I live in Chicago and ride the CTA all the time and am in NYC a decent bit. NYC Subway is generally safer and a more pleasant riding experience compared to the Chicago L.

Actual safety issues on the CTA are rare but anti-social behavior like smoking is unfortunately more common than it should be, especially post 2020. At night I'd recommend sitting on the first car of the train with the operator or taking the buses if you're concerned about this.",1
"Red line can be very scary, other lines not too bad",1
"I think less people riding the CTA definitely make it seem sketchier than the MTA, especially when the doors between the trains swing open and you just know someone who is at minimum going to be a nuisance just walked through.",1
CTA is way less safe than NYC's subway,1
"Live off the brown line if possible because it's the nicest/safest. Lakeview is a popular neighborhood for new residents of Chicago, and it has access to the brown line.",1
"Chicago may have more sketchy characters/smells, but the trains are also not barren. 

More likely than not, you’ll be on a packed car during rush hour or a decently busy one most times of the day. 

I can only speak to the downtown and North Side corridor, but I’ve never felt unsafe (saying this personally with some privilege as a guy). 

In other words, our public transit system isn’t this abandoned network of lines filled with ominous figures. 

It’s very much so vibrant and used by many residents, workers, and tourists. 

Overall, one of my favorite parts about Chicago. ",1
NYC's trains are so crowded that nothing bad could possibly happen without 50 witnesses. You won't find that anywhere else.,1
"I haven’t had any issues with the Chicago trains in the 2 years I’ve been here other than 1 fight take place between a couple drunk guys. I take trains multiple times a week at all times of the day, but I will say that I am tall and built so that is probably part of it.",0
"I ride the CTA all day and night. I love the system. One thing to keep in mind is that Chicago is a far tougher town than New York. As a result, the CTA is more shady than the MTA. Is it truly dangerous? No. But you will run into a lot of drug activity, smoking, crazy homeless people, and aggressive behavior. Violent crime is not truly likely, per se, but far more common than on the MTA. I have had two incidents where I have seen people get robbed as well. You will need to be more aware of your surroundings and less complacent on the CTA.

Each line is different. In my experience, the brown line is by far the most chill, whereas the red line is effing sketchy. The red line is the most popular line, despite the problems it had, and you will likely be stuck with it if you go far north or far south. 

I live on the south side, and the 95th branch of the red line is my line. 69th and 79th are my two stations. On the CTA, that is the roughest of the roughest of all areas on the system. I have never had a problem, however, even late at night (other than being hassled by some whack job) but it is scary until you get used to it. 

The CTA, despite what people may rant about, is an outstanding transit system. But it is fairly gritty. And Chicago will feel far rougher than what you are used to in New York. If you know where you are going, stay alert, be confident, and mind your own business, you should be fine. You will likely be unfamiliar with the city, so research where you are going until you get to know the neighborhoods. 

Depending on your situation, you may have to get off at some rough stops like Pulaski on the green line, for example. Or wait for a bus at 79th and Cottage grove, which is a sketchy intersection. Always know where you are going BEFORE you leave home. If you have to take transit to or through a rough part of town, know and prepare ahead of time. 

Overall, fairly safe, but less so than MTA. ",1

"@kennylof...And I respect that. However, have you ever been accosted by a person with a clear mental disorder? Have you ever been in a position where someone lights up a cig or a crack pipe on a MOVING train while you are with your child? It happened to me while i was with my child and alone (more often when I'm alone). Point is not to hurt people but to be ready to defend. One day as I was exiting a red line train car with my child a man( clearly not in his right mind ) chucked a pair of bulky headphones out and missed my child by less than a foot. I did not say anything or do anything as my child was just fine. However...I was ready to respond. It has nothing to do with WANTING to hurt anyone or get hurt (further) it has to do with self-defense and sometimes even the defense of those around you.",1
So fucking insane we have to deal with shit like this. We need to heavily criminalize crime on trains so people wouldn’t even dare to hit a vape on the platform.,1
Always stay in the front car. Avoid sitting unless the car is empty/ few patrons occupying and carry a heavy object i.e. metal water bottle.,0

I know it’s cold out but the trains aren’t warming stations or shelters and the fact they let it be so normalized is insane. Every train shouldn’t stink and have people coughing/living there. It’s a health hazard",1

"Until people start standing up to others, such behavior will persist.  Not saying it's good in all situations, even on trains, but there's strength in numbers. The government may never be able to make us feel completely safe, but we can try.",1
"I only ride in the front car and I always choose a seat where I can sit my bag next to me until the car becomes packed or busy, if it does. I once had a homeless man follow me onto the car, sit next to me, &amp; expose himself to me, so I’m now the asshole in the wheelchair double seat with my backpack next to me. Sue me. 

I also always keep my pepper gel spray in my coat pocket, ready to access if needed. Gel clings to an assailant and won’t harm anyone else in the car unless they’re hit by the stream! 

Don’t make eye contact with crazies and put your best RBF face on. Sometimes I hype myself up in my head by practicing scenarios in which I have to say, “I’ll mace the fuck out of you, motherfucker.” Unsure if I’d ever be brave enough to say it but confidence and looking unfuckwitable has gotten me through many daily red &amp; green line commutes with tweakers.

i think staying vigilant and paying attention to the people around you is important. see something, say something if you’re with others on the train and feel comfortable. move train cars at a stop, if you feel uncomfortable. when you exit a train car and there’s something weird, tell a cta worker at a stop if there is one - take note of the train car#",1
"Having intermittently done a similar commute on transit, O'Hare to Forest Park is 100x more pleasant on Pace than the Blue Line, and slightly faster anyway. The Rosemont, Cumberland, and Harlem stops all have buses to Forest Park/surrounding areas (the Harlem one is CTA i think but it is a little slower). I think there are a couple from the airport transportation center/metra stop as well. Cumberland &amp; Harlem both also have a lot of stores, restaurants, etc for running errands after work",1

He got off and turned around, trying to size me up. I laughed bc I really couldn't believe how mad he was to want to fight me over that, lol. 

But back to you, tons of Asians take the CTA and the red line (Argyle/Chinatown) at that, which is more ""notorious"" for safety issues, and they're all fine too. Just be cognizant of your surroundings, and you'll be alright.",1
"I’ve ridden every line except the orange. Just know where you’re riding and where you’re going. Especially during the late night. It’s not insane, just normal big city shit.",1

"It’s fine.  I definitely don’t feel nervous when I’m by myself, but If I’m with my kids I don’t like to take it too late at night.  My kids are half Asian and they enjoy taking transport.  Haven’t had a problem but like I said I don’t take em out late.",1
"Short answer: pretty safe as long as you aren't being a dumbass and staying aware of your surroundings.

Long answer: there are a lot of factors at play. Time of day, which line and at what stop along its route, if you're alone or with people, how busy the station and/or car you're in is, etc. I take the train fairly often, and I've never personally ran into any issues or suspect situations, but I know someone who has (he got mugged last year at a downtown red line station). Generally speaking, the local lines like Brown and Pink are generally safer than express or city lines like Red and Blue.

Using any city's public transport necessitates some common sense and awareness of your surroundings. Keep valuables in your pockets or in a bag that you're holding onto. Don't engage with strangers if you don't need to. Don't respond to somebody calling at you if they aren't using your name. Although I'm guilty of it, try not to use the train at night whilst inebriated. And if you have to, you're always safer in a group.

Like I said, the CTA is a pretty safe space as long as you aren't making yourself an easy target or putting yourself in higher-risk situations. But even then, the odds of you getting into trouble are still relatively small. The city has upped its police presence at many stations and stops, and they're working on hiring more drivers/operators so people aren't waiting as long as for trains to arrive.

Edit: spelling",1

Most of the time though, it’s just people sleeping.",1
"My kids have take the CTA alone, all over since they were ten years old.  Their advice, just ignore insane people or move cars at the next stop.",0
"I've never had a safety issue on the CTA in the time I've lived here. A lot of annoying stuff but no violence, and I take the red line in the evening a few times a month",0

It's fine in the morning anyway. My wife is Japanese and transfers through Howard every morning en route to Evanston. Hasn't had any real issues in the the past two years we have lived here. I wouldn't want her to take it alone later in the evening though.,1
"You will be fine enough on the CTA during rush hours and when there's a Cubs game going on.

Generally speaking, if you can take the Metra instead, do that.

If in doubt, ride in the first car with the conductor.",1
"Lived here my whole life except for 2 years when I lived out of state. It’s not what it used to be, that’s for sure. I hardly ever take the CTA at this point &amp; can count on one hand how many times in a year I’ll take the train. I’ll opt for a bus instead or just skip it entirely &amp; take an Uber. 

My only reasons taking public trans was on weekends so I wouldn’t lose my street parking. For myself personally, I don’t feel safe taking the train. The bus is fine if I’m not waiting too long but I’ll just typically grab an Uber.",1
"I don't have an Asian background, but I always feel like it's the same rules for most if not all ethnic groups and genders. 

You just have to be mindful of your surroundings, and be selective as to when you're going to ride.

Usually if it's anywhere between 7:00 in the morning all the way until about 8:00 at night, it's not that big of an issue. Granted you might run into something crazy or insane, but that's the role of the dice with the CTA. Even in rush hour you could have something ridiculous happen. It's just that the ridiculous stuff seems to happen more in the off hours. 

If you absolutely have to ride later than 8:00 at night, then play it safe and get into the first rail car that has the operator, and be mindful of your surroundings. Also best to be in a rail car with more people in it. 

Now I say 8:00 p.m. only because I've noticed that there's always the crazy person, or the drunk, or the junkie roaming around begging and possibly causing trouble. Not necessarily somebody going through rail cars and robbing people. Those stories are usually hear happening at about 2 or 3:00 in the morning. 

There is no guarantee. You just have to be mindful of your surroundings and be street smart. The CTA isn't dangerous, it's just unfortunately a public system which means that bad elements can get on the rail cars.",1

"I was thinking about this today. I would pay a monthly fee for access to the pedway system in the winter.  I feel that more funding, security and police in the pedway could make it great respite from the winter. I’m sad that most of this system is just closed or not open regularly.",1
Why pay more taxes?? Just have a pay cut for all the corrupt cta officials that give there's self's huge bonus and big pay check.. cta makes around $3million a day in fares,1
People want it all. No cops but safety for all. Such a joke.,1
"i can recall 2 times where i was once sexually harassed, and sexually assaulted on a train. i would absolutely be okay with police on trains just patrolling.",1
But the TV told me police is bad and we should get rid of them.,0
"$100 million per year.


Minimum.


Good luck.",1
"Most agree especially with the current state of affairs. Unfortunately some people here voted against just that in our mayoral election. It sad, from about 08 to 2018ish CTA was my only form of transit here, while there has always been shenanigans, it was much safer than it is now. I feel for those who don't have other options.  The guardian angels used to ride the trains whenever there was an incident, are those guys still around? Used to love seeing them on the trains at night.",1
Yes we need police patrol on the CTA TRAINS,1
CTA biggest mistake was disbanding their police department and gave it to CPD. Bring back CTA police department.,0
"""We need the whole city to pay yet another tax for something I want, even though the majority of the city doesn't use  it."" - OP 

No thanks. The budget is already plenty big enough. They need to stop mismanaging funds before asking for more tax revenue.",1
DEFUND the POLICE!!!!,0
"I mean, it could be as simple as a train sweep checkpoints at multiple predetermined trouble spots/stops. It doesn't even have to take dozens of officers if applied efficiently.",1
"People dissing cops: you don’t know any?  No fam, friends?",1
You already pay taxes for it.,0
"You guys pay enough taxes over there. Actually, too much. It’s just being misappropriated and mismanaged. And the Democrats have been in control of the city for more than a century.",0
Bring back the CTA dedicated police force. Allow armed and sworn officers to do their jobs.,1
"The best way to start is if we start prosecuting criminals accordingly like we used to. Luckily we're getting a new DA this November, but boy is Kim Foxx's reign of street terror dragging to come to an end.",1
"So I love that you’re trying to take initiative but it’s not about fast reporting, the CTA employees just do NOT care..or there’s too few of them to efficiently handle crime related issues…am I wrong?",1
That COPS app is pretty awesome!,1
"Honestly having police at stations enforcing the low level stuff like smoking on trains, harassment, D&amp;D on trains would probably make the bad actors that commit the high level stuff like assault and murder stay away. Thus maybe riders would come back.

But there's just no will right now by the police or city officials to enforce the low level stuff.",1
"&gt; “We’ve seen a resurgence of riders … but we haven’t returned to pre-COVID levels,” Rynell added. “Some of that is because we have less service operating out there. Some of it is because the service we have isn’t reliable and good, and some of it is because of the [poor] conditions on the trains and buses.”

Louder for the ones in the back (and at 567 W. Lake).",1
"This is an unpopular opinion, and I’m going to get downvoted to oblivion, but…

The CTA needs a police presence. The people doing most of the things on the CTA are the types of people who would not otherwise be trying those things if there was any chance of being caught and facing consequences. The harassers, the smokers, the perverts, and all but the most stalwart assaulters are not doing that shit if there’s a uniformed cop just feet away from where they are.",1
"yeah it's such a vicious cycle. we need more ridership, but the ridership is staying away, but.... IDK if just throwing money at getting more trains/buses running consistently would help tbh. One thing that was recently pointed out to me is CTA is also one of very few services that provides overnight and I would think that also makes things more difficult.",1
FIRE DORVAL CARTER!!!!,0
"Unfortunately high ridership doesn't deter crime 

There are cameras everywhere on CTA platforms in trains and buses 

It's 98° in July and a group of guys wearing hoodies and face masks just walk past employees in locked booths and get on unnoticed 

I had 2 kids follow me onto the Red line from downtown put his hand on my bike look at me and say I need to get off the deterrent was he was a teenager 5'2"" and 90 pounds wet 

It was a crowded 7 pm weekday Red line heading North 

Chicago police CTA police sit in cruisers next to stations 

When's the last time you saw officers on platforms?

When's the last time you saw dog patrols?

It's a scam by police to get more money even though 30% of the cities budget goes to them 

The apathetic police are the problem",1
"It’s not just crime. It’s also reduced frequency, unreliability, cleanliness, and a lack of any enforcement whatsoever of rules or norms.

I’m a daily CTA rider, but I understand why others are choosing alternatives when choosing the CTA means you’re stranded in the heat/cold/rain, late for work, stuck on a train, breathing in smoke, dealing with harassers, stepping over garbage, etc.",1
"I live in Uptown, work near United Center... Everytime I gave CTA a chance, I'd be confronted with horrible train frequency, disgusting messes in the train cars and the stations, having to be hyper vigilant about potential criminals or crazy people, gross pot smoke, observing heavy drug use, and on and on.

No thanks. I'll pay that $250 for garage parking in my building and get to my work in 25 minutes.",1
Clark bike lanes have reduced my CTA ridership a lot. I feel safer with the cars... I guess I chose the bear?,1
I felt much safer on the CTA ten years ago,1
"I started staying away when we were told that it was unsafe to be in public spaces without a mask and the CTA never enforced mask mandates.  I started driving to the Loop and not only didn't I have to worry about masks, I didn't have to deal with smoking, radio playing, squares, yelling, etc.  

I gave the CTA a couple of chances after the worst of Covid was over, but I felt as unsafe as ever.  The only way I'll go back now is if I have no other choice.",1
For the first time in 12 years I am a car commuter - too old for those shenanigans.,0
Awful leadership all around. We elect the leaders we deserve though.,0
279 million rides where given last year. Which passengers don’t ride?,0
"Really, the outbound Forest Park branch at 5AM isn’t going to be full regardless of the crime situation.",0
Pretty sure the complete unreliability of the CTA atm is the bigger problem with keeping passengers around. It's pretty bad.,1
"I mean if it was reliable people would ride, but it ain't.  Still remember visiting Chicago and being baffled by such bad headways on the blue line.",0
I’m shocked the “security” of people in hi-res vest on their phones is not working,1
"The fact that people on this topic have traded riding the CTA for cars demonstrates that high crime manifests as an expensive stealth tax on those who simply want to be safe.  

The poor, who don’t have a choice, are at the mercy of thugs and the benign neglect of city leaders.

In a sane city the managers of the public transportation system would use the system on a regular basis.  In a sane city, we would populate the system with visible police to enforce the rules and deter crime.  In a sane city, we would vigorously prosecute and incarcerate dangerous offenders.  In a sane city, leaders would not reach back in time to blame straw phantoms like “Richard Nixon” for the persistent virus of anti-social and violent behavior.  

But we do not live in a sane city.  There is no leadership.  There is no “management”.  Zombie voters keep electing chancers in acts of racial solidarity. 

The real Chicago is the dystopian netherworld of the trains.  The real Chicago is the ever vigilant fear of violence.  The real Chicago lies outside my car windows while I drive to be safe and pretend that I live in a sane city.  The real Chicago, up close, with the windows rolled down, is too much to bear.",1
Death penalty for violent crimes/smoking on the CTA.,0
I’m not sure having a lot of people on the train is going to stop anyone from shooting a bunch of people.,0

Everyone needs to vent sometimes. Here's a few resources to help you with the next steps:

1. Contact the CTA directly via their [feedback page](https://www.transitchicago.com/feedback/). Copy/Paste your post to save time. 


2. Find your Alderperson by entering your address [here](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/mayor/iframe/lookup_ward_and_alderman.html). Email their office or meet in person to share your experience. Many offer a weekly ""ward night"" for constituents. This usually  is one on one. 


3. Consider joining activist groups like [Commuter's Take Action](https://www.ctaction.org/) or [Better Streets Chicago](https://www.betterstreetschicago.org/)


4. Sign up for CTA delay alerts [here](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/ILCTA/subscriber/new). Customize based on your chosen Bus or L line. Elevator outages alerts are also an option.

Genuinely surprised he’s not doing it directly across from you lol most of the times they don’t even care to do it in the corner anymore,1
Been a lot of crackheads and crazies on the L lately. I've noticed,0
Don't record anything in a situation like that you need to get as far away as possible as quickly as possible and then report it in the best way that you can in a safe way I shouldn't need to remind you that people smoking crack don't usually value human life when they get upset,1
The first time I saw someone smoke crack on the red line was in the 90s so good luck with your plea.,1
The CTA doesn’t care.,1
"Years ago, probably around 2018, I sat down on the blue line and noticed a blood-soaked syringe sitting a few inches from my arm in the window sill. That’s when I started taking Metra for my commute downtown.",0
god forbid a guy catch a vibe smoking crack,1
"I have seen that happening quite a bit (crack) in the suburban PACE buses, far more out in the open than even that.",0
Welcome to Public Transportation in Chicago baby🤣🤣,1
if you ain’t coughing you ain’t smoking,0
You said the red line...enough said.,0
this is like being mad at he police when a crime happens.,1
Orange line in the loop 2 women 1 guy and a toddler smoking weed right on the train. Security walked by didn't give a shit. (Toddler was not smoking lol) I don't take the train ever. Decided to do so....makes me feel bad for everyone who rides daily.,1
"Could’ve sworn this was on the Blue line too yesterday. Announcer said no smoking and some dude (who was in similar clothing to this guy…) starts hitting that lighter like it was on its last drop of fuel. CTA should have officers ride trains more and bus drivers enforce payment. Sorry, CTA BUS rant going forward. Most people who cause problems, in my experience, are people who don’t pay, and the drivers let them ride for whatever reason. I pay for the pass, my taxes go to the CTA services, why should those who can’t pay be allowed to ride and make the paying customers ride miserable?",1
Watching this while ina red line that smells like someone smoked in here about 5 min ago,1
It’s the worst feeling when you want to smoke crack but have no lighter,1
Literally need police on every other car.,0
**NEVER** record these people. 80% of the times I’ve seen crazies lash out at people is because they thought they were being recorded.,0
"As long as it’s not the motorman, I’ll let it go…",0
"Relax, it's not blue peter! Just a nice little relaxing smoke of crack.",1
Genuinely interested: How does a transit system prevent this? Do they just put armed security on every vehicle? Have people cavity searched prior to boarding? Is it preventable?,1
They're definitely not gonna clean it up. Everybody has to just exist around them. 🙄,1
I mean at least they did it in a corner away from everyone 🤣,0
I had ro ask a couple a couple of em go to the next cart on that green line coming from harlem and lake. That has to be the worst station. Coke sniffing and crack smoking,0
I thought they were taking a dump at first,0
"Just change cars at the next station, truly I’ve ever only seen that at night never during the day lol",1
Let the guy smoke his peace pipe in peace,1
The mayor wants it like this. Keeps crime rates down by not charging them,1
lol a blast on the redline 💨,1
Everyday thing u see on cta train or buses no more security too they took that funky company out all the security was ex gangbanger etc,1
"CTA employees are also getting lit. Big Shitty living in the big midwestern shitty(with lousy public transportation). 

Be happy you’re not living in your car 4 hours a day with the 10th wave of construction on the Kennedy.",1
"Hey did you know, once upon a time the CTA had their own cops? They kept shit like this from happening. Now the trains are a mobile homeless shelter/halfway house. If you called the cops ain't no one showing up. Enjoy the results of city policy. You voted for this.",1
They are actually making the train smell better than the usual stench of piss.,1
"Use the CTA chat to report it!

https://www.transitchicago.com/contact/",0
This happens in nyc as well I just dont understand the fascination of these morons to do this on trains.,1
Pepper gel would help in this situation.,1
"Lemme guess, Blue Line?",0
Ummmmm don’t you feel you’re a little too close to CRACK smoke?!,0
Still nowhere as bad as it was in the 80s.,1
The sucky thing is it is your job to report them.,0
Carry pepper spray and mace these fuckers when you see them doing it 🤷‍♂️,0
I mean start sending these crackheads to a gulag for 10-15 years would fix it just saying,0
"Call the Police or CTA and tell them what train line you are on and what direction you are traveling, as well as, the train car number. Sometimes they will notify the engineer and he/she will temporarily stop the train at a station to investigate, or call for an arrest.",1
If you be nice he might give you a hit 😋,1
Whaddya mean? That's medical crack,0
"I mean, if a guy can't do crack in his own frunchroom, then where would you like him to do it!?",1
Get this guy a new lighter!! Geeeesh!,0
"Winter 2016, decided I would see a movie downtown with my buddy and as we were transferring in the narrow escalator area from pink to blue we witnessed a nearly frozen from the cold man smoking crack. His face and state will never leave my memory. This shit is sad.",1
"I was on the red line and, unfortunately, saw some lady giving her man head in that little corner.",1
Lotsa big narc energy up in here.,1
"At least the guy isn't taking a shit.

Fuck I hate that privacy like area  people decide to do WTF ever they want.

When I was there mostly piss and shit.",1
"I hope that person gets help for their addiction, and it's kind of weird of you to record them.",1
No fucking way an actual crackhead ?!?,0
"You must be new or something because homeless addicts have been using on the transit system for decades. Honestly, you gotta do what I used to do and buck up and say something. Most of them will move on to another car or even exit the train. This is a societal issue, though. I recently moved back to the city and am appalled at the number of homeless encampments I’ve seen set up. One would have to imagine that some of those homeless would gain access to the CTA. It’s really very sad and infuriating how the problem is ignored in the “wealthiest nation on earth”.",1
Whoah is that someone hitting a pookie right there in the middle of the day,0
"Why not report it to CTA or the police while it's happening, rather than to reddit?",0
how is there not a rule on this sub to not post videos of people doing drugs?,0
"Let her get high in peace, dude",1
WHO ARE YOU TO JUDGE &amp; record… clean your own side of the street !,1
y’all need more compassion ffs,1
 How is this the ctas fault? Lol they can’t prevent every junkie from stumbling in the cars when it’s cold outside,1
Crack heads are victims,0
I mean seems like he’s just tucked away tryna be discrete. Better than just in the middle of the train,1
"I get off work around 10 a lot of nights and I notice around 25 security guards just chilling on the back of the Clark/Lake Blue Line platform.  Are they getting off work?  They certainly aren't patrolling.

What a grift for these security companies providing the labor.",1
They’re not effective when they actually don’t do the job anyway. They let the homeless sleep on 3 seats still when the train is full to the airport and walk right by. They let a guy blast crappy music and rap at the Roosevelt exit.,0
"I don’t get why CTA doesn’t just use the money to directly hire transit ambassadors and use that as a recruiting path for train operators, similar to what we do with flaggers right now. That way, we still get the unarmed patrolling to help with customer service, contacting the correct counterparts if they encounter a medical emergency or dangerous activity, etc. while also being an investment in developing an employee pipeline for train operators, which has shown to be a real issue post-COVID.

It seems like such an obvious win-win, am I missing something here?",1
I just saw these deployed on the Green Line in Boston. Very sleek and cool.,1
"I don’t know if it’s on a specific schedule, but I know it’s only at some stations/lines. It’s usually the stations or lines that are busier and/or have more incidents. For example they’re almost never at Southport brown but they’re frequently at Jackson red/blue",0
They’re only there out of convenience,0
"&gt;i always feel safer when i see them at the stations cause i feel like stations are more likely to have crime compared to trains

I find it odd anyone would feel *safer* with CPD around.",1
The hotel near Adams/Wabash will give you direct access to all the lines that go through downtown. So it's the better option. Riding in the head car on any line is usually safest since the train operator is right there.,1
"Roosevelt is a bigger stop that connects orange, red, and green lines.  I definitely see reports of more problems there than almost any other L stop. It could be perception but I would go with Monroe.",1
"Orange Line is super safe. I would go with Adams and Wabash, it is less crazy and also you'll be in the Loop and can get anywhere you want on public transit from there.",1
I’m not a fan of Roosevelt station. Been using it weekly for 3 months and without fail there’s a screaming crazy person around just about all the time at around 10pm. Not ever the same person.  Was literally just there and a random lady was a screaming at the grocery store and then another at the station.,1
"I’d say just be alert. I don’t mean that to sound scary or anything, I just mean don’t putz around on your phone or whatever. Just get on, be aware, get off. You’ll likely be just fine.",1
Easy answer. Avoid Roosevelt.,1
Both are fineeeee but Monroe def better of the two,1
"Both those stops are super safe downtown areas. Basically all of downtown is inundated with police 24/7. There’s cops parked everywhere. Downtown is heavily policed. And a huge tourist area. Roosevelt is not some far off stop compared to Monroe it’s literally a few blocks walk it’s all a strip on State St. and to be quite honest even late night you’re gonna run into a lot of normal people getting off service industry jobs waiting for busses and trains. I’ve lived in a lot of major cities and Chicago has one of the cleanest safest downtowns at anytime it day. It’s the bread and butter of tourism and the city knows it. South side is a different story that’s where the crime actually is.

Edit: and it may be normal in other cities for downtown be deserted but 3am-5am people are often going to work. You’re far more likely catch people going to early jobs than criminals or junkies",1
"Hi, I am a bot. I think you might be asking about public transit in Chicago. (or maybe not. The guy who wrote me is an idiot so he probably screwed it up)

"Roosevelt is my home station. Right around the station and the jewel there things can get a little weird, but there’s also constantly cops posted there and I regularly shop at the jewel, never had any problems. It’s a very busy stop because it’s also a bus hub. 

I live here so to me Roosevelt is just regular life haha",1
Roosevelt feels fine during the weekday and rush hours. Would avoid it any other time though.,1
I lived off of the Roosevelt stop for three years. There were only a handful of questionable incidences. Just be aware of your surroundings and you’ll be fine!,1
"Roosevelt Red Line is sketch AF. Stay away. 

Getting in and out of the station the stop at the Green/Orange is also to be avoided at night.",0
