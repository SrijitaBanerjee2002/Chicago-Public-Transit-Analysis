"I love it. It's like a museum artifact that doubles as a transit system. Parts of it for sure need upgrades, and the city could benefit from some new, modern metro-style lines like Sydney and Toronto are building, but the character of the current L is such an iconic part of the city's character.

Question though - to what extent is our affinity for the L limited to the actual elevated parts? Like, are the subways under State and Dearborn considered as 'special' as the turn-of-the-century style elevated portions of the network?",1
"It needs to be upgraded, with an economy bigger then most countries on earth Chicago should be able to make every station look modern and better",1
I had a higher opinion of the L before I had to ride it.,0
"Perhaps it could be intriguing to preserve one station as a 'Historical Gem' to honor its original design and significance. However, for the hundreds of thousands of users, as well as those working, walking, or living nearby, the overall state of disrepair these stations are in is quite disheartening. The glaring issues range from their poor condition, a lack of accessibility features for people with disabilities, to the excessive noise, inadequate lighting at night, limited space, and overall instability. It’s puzzling to see how this line has not been prioritized for renovation. In many other countries, a project to modernize such a line would have been undertaken LONG ago.",1
"Is that Clark/Lake station?

Yeah, I love the L. I go to Chicago frequently to moderate Quiz Bowl tournaments in Rosemont and usually take the L downtown before the tournament starts so I can sightsee. When I visited a friend at LUC we took the L everywhere. Coming from small town Oklahoma it's shocking to me how amazing it is and now I'm planning on moving to a city with public transit",1
"The Loop L is so much fun to ride.

I don’t think a circle line L is likely in the foreseeable future, but there could be BRTs between the radial L lines.",1
if only the officials here thought the same,0
"I'm going to Chicago soon, should I give it a try or not bother with the potential of whatever weirdos to encounter?

Admittedly been humbled by Europe being synonymous with public transit for any person of any wealth.

Still feels like unless its NYC public transit in US is synonymous with being used by lesser people per say.",1
"Great system overall, but a ton of missed transfers, bad integration with commuter rail, and wacky station spacing in some spots. Also service is a lot less frequent than it should be.",1
"The L train is a great system that can only be improved upon I would say it is in tier 2 behind cities 
Such as Washington DC and New York in terms of usability for every day activities",1
Excellent city- and people-watching,1

I wonder if there's a way to make it quieter. I lived in Chicago for 7 years and never got used to the noise of a passing train!,0
Seems cool. I imagine people drinking a coffee seated at tables right next to the tracks watching trains come and pass by... You know like if the towers built restaurants with patios on the train height...,1
"Love the L.  I live next to 3 lines so it’s easy to get around.  Couple of things I wish for and number 1 is speed.  We gotta improve speed in the next 10 years.  I would also like to see either a western or Ashland loop or line. Connecting with maybe the 47th and Western Orange on the s side and maybe the western brown line.  It seems like it would be pretty good coverage if they do that.  And ohare midway line might be helpful but I would put less priority on that unless they make it really fast, with a connection in oak park (cross the green line, and maybe Cicero hitting up either the metra or pink line). #FireDorvalCarter",1
"The ""L"" is a W",0
"Ooof... bro, if you're gonna call it a treasure, then at least snap a pic of a station worthy of that descriptor (like Quincy).  😄  LaSalle / Van has seen better days. Though I will say the Pink platform's west side view down Dearborn is pretty epic for Chicago architecture fans.",1
"It's not a truly comprehensive transit system, and yet it's one of the only usable light rail systems in America. I've got a real love/hate relationship with it, always have.",1
"I have lived in Chicago and traveled all over the US over the past year (DC, NYC, Boston, Austin, Dallas, Milwaukee, the Twin Cities and a few others), and I've used many, many systems across Europe.

In the US, only New York City is (way) better than Chicago. I found the DC Metro safe, frequent and reliable, but the bus system is bad, while Chicago has good coverage.

When comparing to other countries, Chicago's system is abysmal to say the least. Nowhere else have I seen people shouting nonsense in stations, smoking drugs on trains, trash everywhere, and absolutely useless theater security (not even New York despite what people also say there). Delays are bad, but the poor passenger information (Ghost trains/buses, no service announcements) make it even worse. Never have I seen timekeeping this bad and the operators don't seem to care. My trips to the Loop could take anywhere from 45 to 90 minutes.

Also a rapid transit system ought to be operated more than every 15 minutes.

Howard haunts me in my nightmares. The Purple Line just seems to show up randomly, and I've stopped counting the times it departed just as the Red was coming in, and the times I waited for over 30 minutes in the cold with no information or alternative.

At least it's not Minneapolis-St. Paul, spent 4 days there and that place looks like The Walking Dead.",1
"I think a lot of people compare the CTA with the MTA, saying the latter is better but if you live in an affordable area in Brooklyn or Queens the MTA can be much worse in my experience. Like the train not running in your neighborhood at all for an entire weekend because of planned work level.

It’s also much wetter. Flooding, puddles, etc is much worse.

London is my fav system but it’s so far ahead of anything in the US it’s not funny.",1
"The CTA’s service isn’t that awful compared to other American mass transit agencies. We have relatively reliable 24/7 train service that covers a significant percentage of the city’s population. The CTA’s customer experience is garbage. Trains are dirty, smoking is constant, during the winter trains are essentially homeless shelters, and staff aren’t responsive to concerns. I’ve found other agencies to do a better job in regard to this.",1
I just had friends visit from Boston and they loved the CTA and couldnt believe how the buses and trains went everywhere,1
"DC Metro is cleaner and more reliable, but the fact that it’s not 24/7 brings it down. Similarly, as incredible as the Tokyo metro and other international train systems are, I HATE that they stop running around midnight or 1am. So I have to hand it to CTA and NYT",1
I’m on the train right now and just had to move carts because I guy had his dick out in his hand so there’s that.,1
"No system is perfect, but the CTA is dead last in recent experience. Out of curiosity I actually started keeping a journal and I see on-train smoking or someone in mental/housing crisis about 1 in 3 trips. NYC was excellent across the board last time I was there. Trains in Buenos Aires were phenomenally clean and under control. Not saying outliers don’t exist in these places but seemingly at a much lower rate that made me sad to return to the CTA lol",1
"So talking only about my experiences **this year** (since 1 January 2024):

**London (2.5ish weeks)**  
TfL while it has good coverage with the Tube and the the buses go to most major things has a bad habit of not updating GIS data for known and planned events leading to such issues as you **and your bus driver** having absolutely no clue where you should get off the bus in order to get to your apartment. For the London Marathon, they didn't even bother giving route maps to the drivers, they were just required to follow road signage that was posted by the police seemingly at random with no coordination with TfL. This led to an extremely stressful journey from the train station that was supposed to get us close enough for a direct bus to our rented apartment when we had arrived after a red eye flight.  
As for maintenance issues, TfL was incredibly clean in the paid/ticketed areas but had many of the QoL issues that we have in the non-paid/non-ticketed areas such as shit and piss. Wraparound services at the national level to reduce homelessness and open drug trafficking were very obvious but those are not an issue controllable by a transit system. However on the trains, we had several train seats that were obviously extremely far beyond their reasonably useful life with one almost stabbing me. We reported that seat to the a train operator and when using the same train 3 days later (by coincidence), it was not fixed or blocked off in any way.  
In terms of runs and frequency, TfL was still very much facing staffing issues leading to decreased service in Zones 3 and 4 as they were short-turning a lot of trains in Zone 2. This was a major point of contention in the London mayoral elections that were ongoing while we were there. But if you're a tourist, you're probably staying in Zones 1 and 2 most of the time so you'll be lulled into thinking everything is peachy unless you go out of your way to experience Zones 3 and 4 right now.  
Overall, the experience was similar to MTA in NYC albeit with worse coverage of the central area by train but better coverage of the outlying areas. The national rail system helps cover some of the gaps but the separate ticketing for in-city stops is quite frustrating. Coverage south of the Thames leaves much to be desired but that is the main area that TfL is working on expanding service in right now so they're at least working on it.

**NYC Trip (4 days)**  
I spent a bit in NYC this year. Now, normally I spend 1-3 weeks but as I'm in-between jobs, I chose to focus on other cities more so it was just a long weekend.   
Last year, I wrote a great review of how MTA had clearly used the pandemic to fix a ton of maintenance issues and it felt so much better than pre-pandemic. This trip was a bit worrying though. Tons of maintenance issues had come up again and the lack of funding from the state for ongoing, preventative maintenance was definitely showing. The cleaning regime that had been put in place during the pandemic was clearly no longer being as strictly enforced and the experience was just worse compared to late fall of last year in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn.  
Overall, **MTA is probably the best transit system in North America** but I still wouldn't rate it as high as Vienna or Munich. But I need to visit both cities again as it has been awhile. And well, Gov. Kathy Hochul is just another in a long line of NY governors trying to kill everything good about NYC.

**Amtrak Acela (1 trip)**  
Honestly, there's not much bad to say about the train. We took it from NYC to DC one week after they launched the new food menu and everything on the new menu was pretty decent for train food. The ride was smooth on the newer tracks, bumpy on the older ones, and was only a bit slower than I would expect of ICE trains in Europe. I guess if I had to criticize it, the seats are very dated and the patterns on the fabric is very visibly fading.

Note: DC/WMATA and CTA commentary in my comment; ran out of space here",1
"Moved here from Philly and the CTA is a blessing compared to SEPTA. With SEPTA it’s easier for me to count the number of times I haven’t been on a train with someone smoking something. The homeless on SEPTA are also so aggressive and the city does nothing about it (I personally never had issues but knew people that got spit on, physically attacked, etc. Chicago homeless sure will panhandle you but I’ve seen less aggressive and dangerous behavior here. I’m a daily blue line rider and most of the time they’re just trying to sleep in one of the few places where they have a roof over their head, who can fault someone for doing that when the city provides next to no alternatives?). Also all the train stations are filthy with SEPTA, CTA does a pretty good job of cleaning the stations. Communication is also leaps and bounds better, CTA transit app has been very accurate in my experience, with SEPTA the app is not real time and there’s nothing in the stations that tell you when to expect the next train so it’s all a guess. And there’s no communication about bus detours like there is with CTA. Yes CTA can be better, but at least it ain’t Philly’s disaster of transit and for that I’m grateful.",1
"I tell my gf all the time the CTA is one of the worst I’ve experienced. In The US it’s top 4ish with MTA,WMATA, and NJ transit being better IMO.

In North America CDMX, Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouvers metros all have better ridership",1
Compared to everywhere outside the USA… atrocious.,0
"I moved to NYC a year ago after living in Chicago for the previous 6 years. I live in East Harlem, not the nicest part of town.

My experience is that I see way more drug addicts / homeless people out on the streets where I live now than I did in Chicago, but way less of that on the trains (though plenty in the stations).

I feel way, **way** safer on both the streets and trains here in NYC than I did in Chicago. A couple years ago I had a crazy guy pull a knife on me on the purple line at 930AM.

Here in NYC I've never experienced anything close to the things I'd regularly see on the red line after the pandemic. The CTA really is a nightmare compared to the MTA, especially after the pandemic.",1
"It's worse than metros outside of the USA (because the USA lags behind pretty much every other developed country) and it's behind all major US cities. But for what it's worth, it's MILES better than what the majority of Americans have access to. The fact that there are several areas in the CTA network where coverage is so comprehensive that you can reasonably live without your own car is a massive privilege. Moving here from Cleveland, I was blown away by how competent of a system it is.


CTA is a solid system and it has good bones. It definitely needs help, better leadership, and more funding, but it's so much better than most systems in the US.",1
"I can only compare it to Europe especially Cracow Poland, and Cracow takes all the awards, but it’s not a fair comparison because American cities are just different. The public transportation in Cracow is simply amazing. I am just mostly grateful for the CTA that it even exists, and I am super stoked to be living so close to the Red Line.",1
"CTA is pretty good, Bostons been a shit show for the past year and a half, but it’s getting better.",1
"The CTA train is very unsafe, the buses are fine. I took the train to the loop and a mental ill man sitting across from me was threatening me and said he will kill me and how he was going to do. I did not look him directly in the eye but I moved train cars as fast as I could, I was not waiting to find out. I love transit but the CTA trains are a mental asylum at this point.",1
"Compared to London, where I am right now, it is laughable in terms of frequency, coverage, efficiency, cleanliness, etc",1
"When my kid was at U of MN, I used that tram thing a few times going to and from the airport.  Wasn't a bad experience at all. What was bad about your experience? Just curious.",1
"I'm an outsider who's never been to Chicago so my insights will be different from a native &amp; that's the benefit. As someone who's had to deal with the issues of boston, I think there comparisons that can be made. Ofc I can't day definitely what will fix the issues of the cta, but heres my take. From what I've read here on reddit &amp; in the media it's a bunch of things which I'll break down in no particular order. 

Short staffing 
Without needed staff, busses trains &amp; other positions cause a snowball effect for other issues. If there's not enough people to do runs, more people need to wait at their bus or l stop to get to where they need to. This will deter ridership &amp; make things worse. 

Backlog of maintenance 
Perceived &amp; real safety issues:
Safety matters in both a perceived &amp; real way. If you see dirty or unkempt stations or areas, you might think things are neglected &amp; not looked after. This leads you as a rider to second guess using the system.  If there's a real safety issue like people acting out or threatening others, you definitely will notice this &amp; might have issues finding staff for help. Either way the results are the same. You avoid the L as a whole. 


Slow zones &amp; not enough equipment for needed service
As someone who uses the t in Boston that's had issues with slow zones,  I know what it's like &amp; how they suck. This contributes to not having enough trains for runs. If trains need to run slower, less of them are able to finish runs &amp; be used again.  This also leads to longer headways discouraging usage. It's a situation that leads to 2 problems. With less trains in use users might turn to other modes. Even though there could be more demand for the bus, there's not enough personal to drive them leading to long headways just like on the l with the same result. 

It also doesn't help that many people want Dorval out the door, which is a 180 from boston, where the new gm has managed to turn things around in some ways.  

Overall, it's a lot of problems &amp; there's going to be a lot of debate about how to fix things.",1
"I never fully appreciated the CTA until I spent a year living in San Francisco. CTA is by no means perfect, but at least it's not BART.",1
Laughing maniacally in Atlanta.,1
Comparison to other cities is useless.  The amount of complaints that I have seen on this sub and my daily personal experience riding the Green and Blue line for the last 25 years has shown me the management at CTA don’t care in the slightest.  It’s a pit.  I am counting the days I can drive into the city.,1
"It’s pretty bad. Even my small college town had more reliable public transportation than CTA. But compared to outside the US? Embarrassing. 

By the way, one of the Chicago bucket boys that plays outside the Art Institute regularly is also a red line drug dealer. I saw it with my own eyes.",1
"It is not normal, especially if you compare CTA to Chicago's global peers like Paris or Osaka.",1
Howard. Having to go up and then back down to go to the platform isn’t my favorite thing.,1
"Addison Red Line.

Relatively short, narrow platform that only operates redline trains. Cubs fans clog up the platform and it’s hard/dangerous to shuffle around the crowd because the platform is so narrow. There are no purple or brown lines stopping at the station to ease the congestion. And you can only enter through the north side entrance.

Whole station is terribly designed to be THE station for Cubs games/ Cubs crowds",1
"Loyola seems pretty bad. Extremely narrow platforms, and it’s also hard to see how they are going to expand the station if they decide to make it a purple line stop as well.",1
Probably State and Lake for me. I always get scared I'm going to be pushed off when its busy.,0
The one in the middle of a highway,0
"I have three criteria for a badly designed station:

Land usage, design, and operations.

The worst land usage, potentially of any train station in the entire country, is Rosemont Blue Line. If you’ve never seen it, it literally sits in the middle of a cloverleaf interchange. It’s functionally inaccessible by foot.

The worst operations in the system are Howard and I don’t think anyone is arguing that.

The design I personally hate the most is split between any of the highway stops like 47th Red Line or Illinois Medical District.
That’s a cookie cutter answer though, and there are many of those everywhere, so my “unique” answer is Loyola on the red line. Platform is dangerously small, outdated, and the inbound/outbound platforms are separated from each other.",1
"Irving Park.

Incredibly narrow platform.

in the middle of the Kennedy (noise, pollution, wind)

Entrances/exits are only in filthy underpasses.

Pedestrian approaches from most every direction are seriously treacherous.

No accessible entry.",0
"Sheridan is pretty rough. I don’t think it’s worst designed, but it needs some renovation",1
"Logan Square if entering from the Spaulding side. You could be at the turnstile, train will roll up and you’d miss it because it is so far.",0
"*Designed*? Granville red line isn’t the worst, but is pretty terrible, mostly because there is one exit, and there is a part of the platform *which is about 12 inches wide* that everyone has to walk on to get down to the street level when they leave a train, and you could get smacked by the train as it starts departing- easily.

It’s an accident/death waiting to happen.",1
"Granville is also extremely narrow. When passengers get off the train and are heading to the exit, they are sandwiched between a glass enclosed escalator and the departing train. There’s barely enough room for foot traffic in one direction, and people try to stay very close to the glass on the opposite side. When there’s foot traffic in both directions, the risk of slamming into the moving train becomes very high.",0
"State and Lake — excessively narrow, rundown, reeks of piss, and no accessibility options",0
State and lake. Platforms are too narrow and there’s no mezzanine level,0
Outdated design doesn’t really bother me as long as they are safe and clean.,1
"Maybe not the worst, but California blue line annoys the hell out of me. Climb the stairs, then almost always have to carefully squeeze by everyone waiting on the very slim platform.",1
Sheridan. Narrow but also feels like I’m tilting.,1
belmont blue line. why the fuck is there not an entrance to the subway on the northeast corner of kimball and belmont so the west bound 77 busses dont have to do an unnecessary (and difficult with traffic) loop into the blue line,1

"The southern entrance at Roosevelt has emergency exit doors that are pretty much always being propped open for fare evaders (usually smoking as well), so there’s that",1

I know red line modernization construction is ongoing, but any idea why it feels like the commute between Thorndale and North/Clybourn is getting longer and rides are becoming more delayed? 

Last question, any advice on how to become less afraid or phobic of the train?

What's the name of the job of the person who sits in the front of the train next to the operator and looks down the length of the train to see if the doors are clear? Or at least I'm guessing that's what they do. Seems like you'd end up with a stiff neck doing that all day.,1

"I’m going to argue the other side of things— just to start the conversation.

The Chicago CTA is not really an special case when talking about public transit in the states— the MTA, the DART, the BART, MARTA… all have the same issues that you describe. Not only that, but I would say that the CTA is probably one of the most used rail systems in the USA, second to the MTA and maybe BART. (Maybe the DC transit as well, but I’m not as familiar.) The lesser used transit systems are in much worse states than the CTA and have much less city coverage.

The problem lies in the fact that the US is intrinsically a car-centric country. Nobody cares about a system they aren’t using, and even places like NYC and Chicago, driving is the predominant method of transportation. There is no point in assigning more resources to a system if the ridership will not increase alongside it.

Homelessness is an issue with completely different causes, but the end result is the same. If I have no where to go, I’m going to go *somewhere*. Most businesses will not allow a homeless person to enter. The city trains are warm, enclosed, and have chairs you can sit on… which is the jackpot for someone who is transient across the city. Plus, someone who is not allowed to properly participate in society is not going to care about societal rules. Finally, policing these behavior on the train takes police resources we already don’t have, and doesn’t fix the problem. Once the offender is released, they’re going to go back to the same behaviors because there is nothing else to choose.

In order to fix the problems on the CTA— you’d need to tackle the homelessness and mental health issues in Chicago, which is a complex problem in itself. You’d also have to find some way to change the deeply ingrained US driving culture, which would most likely take decades, a concerted amount of effort, and a lot of money. 

The CTA has many problems, sure. But what you’re describing is a multi-faceted problem that is as old as Chicago itself… and looking at the rest of the country, the fact that Chicago even has a working rail system with a substantial ridership is a big leg up on some of the other cities. LA has a much bigger population and their subway system has the same problems you describe above, compounded tenfold.

As a transplant, I am just glad to have a working transit system that shows up (mostly) on time, takes me where I need to be, and offers me options to get around the city. You could very easily not own a car in this city. There aren’t many other cities in the US where that is feasible or realistic.",1
"I AM SO TIRED OF THE SMOKING. I have had to switch cars many times over in one train because there were ONE OR MORE PEOPLE SMOKING. Yesterday I was sitting in the end of a car and this motherfucker pulled up in front of me and started smoking a cigarette. Like dude, REALLY?? Like come on man, have some common decency and blow your smoke outdoors. I've travelled to japan this past year and the lack of decency riders have here embarrassing. Do better Chicago.",1
Why do we surrender our vital public transit spaces to become homeless shelters and havens for criminality?  These are our trains!  Throw these bums and criminals off.  They shouldn’t be the problem of the working commuter.  And we should be done caring about how letting them ruin the trains is some sort of social or racial equity project.,1
"CTA has never been world renowned, but it’s almost always been very good. Around the start of pandemic, for various reasons, our leadership chose stopped enforcing basic laws and make the trains essentially a Wild West. Sure there are homeless people, but there have always been homeless people, that’s not really the issue here. 

What we now allow is able bodied drug dealers to run up and down the cars, openly smoke, and intimidate commuters, and sell drugs without recourse. This was never a thing pre 2020. There are 10+ prosecutable offenses here and them occurring on CTA is supposed to increase the charges like it’s a school zone. We decide not to do any of this and just let the demise happen, even though we have everything in place to prevent this. The demise is contagious too, sane people going to work that would never consider this in the past are now smoking/vaping on CTA.",1
"Yeah. I understand why it’s the way it is, but it’s frustrating that there has been no progress. And actually seems to be getting worse. I’m a huge advocate for public transit and wish it was more reliable and a better option, but I’ve essentially given up on it. I have an e-bike and while it’s not great struggling to stay safe on my rides, it’s likely a lot faster and not as frustrating as dealing with constant delays.",1
American car culture is the worst..we should be able to get around alot easier in the U.S..,1
The homeless and crazies on the L need to be stopped. They aren’t welcome and likely are just riding just to ride so they get out of the weather. God knows they’re probably just jumping the turnstiles too instead of paying. I was in the first train car thinking it was a safe bet yet a homeless guy still lit up a cigarette. I got off and told the conductor at their window and they got the guy to stop but didn’t remove him or notify the police as they’re expected to,1
"I feel like we could prioritize these things. We keep hearing that there aren't enough cops/security/CTA personnel to make things better -- okay, so leave the people sleeping alone. They're quiet and not bothering anybody. Deal with smoking/loud sloppy public intoxication/rogue shitting first. Then start cleaning the cars more. If somebody wants to take a nice quiet nap, I don't mind standing up so they can do that. 

But if you want to blare your soundcloud rapping and blow weed smoke in my face I feel like that's a whole different thing.",1
"The CTA is an American transit system, and American transit systems lag behind their European counterparts b/c of U.S. car culture, unfortunately.

At the end of the day, Chicago has much better transit than many other cities in this country, especially in the West and South. I love living in Chicago without a car, and I love the CTA with it’s flaws. People sleeping on the trains, smoking weed and tobacco on trains, and so on, is annoying, but it’s not the end of the world.

The only thing I can’t forgive is piss and shit on the platforms or in trains, and people exposing themselves/masturbating/going to the bathroom in public, because that’s unsanitary and inappropriate. Fortunately, I don’t think that’s as common as people think it is.

Also, I will say this: as someone with work experience getting the homeless into housing, homelessness is not a choice, it’s an unfortunate situation many people are in because of extreme poverty. The homeless are victims, not villains. Many of their mental health issues develop due to them being homeless, not vice versa, and I see a lot of people in this subreddit victim blaming them.

Seeing homeless people on the CTA is ugly, but the answer is to help get them back on their feet and into housing, without requiring them to get sober, because addiction is an illness, not a personal choice. And seriously, put bathrooms in the stations. Then people don’t have to piss and shit on the platforms or in trains.",1
"Elections have consequences is the hard reality.  Now in Chicago this is not something I ever take for granted but current politicians were elected who firmly believe in ""restorative justice"" and many were proud to claim openly that this was the pathway forward without acknowledging the clear issues many are stating here are now commonplace.  Why complain when an overwhelming number of voters elected Brandon Johnson, Kim Foxx, and others?  It's going to take years to turn this around and there are fixes but no one wants to arrest and incarcerate, that's why we have laws in the first place.  Can't have it both ways without a complete breakdown in society.  Be frustrated at the ballot box or leave to a city which isn't run by it's criminals.  Simple as that.",1
Chicago sucks. Fuck this place,0
It's getting so bad that I am considering biting the bullet and getting a car. I took the redline in morning last week and I couldn't escape them by moving cars because they were literally on every car. I pretty much had to choose between the car full of cracked out schizo homeless people making a scene or the car where homeless people were sleeping on and stinking up the train forcing me to stand. I went with the latter.,1
"I ride a bike and refuse to take the trains, and I just suggest everyone do the same. I can't tell if your experience with overseas trains is you having moved here or just having spent an extended amount of time overseas, but watching everything fall apart, get worse, and never be improved upon is the story of the past 30-50 years in this country. If you're waiting for things to get better.... good luck.",1
"I think a lot of people do resonate with this sentiment, especially after a trip to Europe. They do seem to have incredible clean and effective transit.

A lot of CTA's difficulties are part of Chicago's difficulties as a whole though. The CTA has a budget for security, but their main reliance for security is the CPD. CPD don't really seem to do much, especially when it comes to crimes on trains. 

When it comes down to it though, increasing CPD presence likely won't help with the main problem: homelessness. CTA gets a lot of the attention as many see what is happening on the trains, but really, the Chicago Housing Authority has been doing a terrible job at providing housing, and it doesn't seem like they get as much of this frustration directed towards their ineffectiveness. It seems to me that the CTA is the last line of defense for people to be able to continue to survive homelessness because there is just so little that is put into welfare. The trains are the only warm place you can stay in that operates 24/7.

Also, density surrounding the CTA stations should increase to provide more housing connected to a variety of modes of transportation, but City of Chicago Zoning doesn't permit higher density housing near a lot of different stations.

All in all, there is a lot wrong going on, but there's a multitude of ways we could go about fixing these issues through the interactions we have with our government. I still have to say, even with all the issues present on the CTA, I still love our train system.",1
Yeah I'm tired of that shit too. I want to smell cleaning supplies and see the beautiful scenery not smell weed and a unshowered human. It may sound insensitive but the shit is irritating,1
This is exactly why I quit riding the CTA. The Metra seems okay still but I would always rather deal with traffic jams and exorbitant parking fees than subject my children to the loony bin that L cars have become.,1
"It’s definitely frustrating but I feel for anyone who has to solicit or sleep on the train. The thing that’s really been driving me crazy is that I have to use a mobility aid and tell me why there are so many stops that have no elevator or even the ones that do it’s about a 30% shot I’ll get to the station and it’ll just not work and I’m stranded. There also seems to be a lot of people either pissing, doing drugs, or leaving behind trash in the elevators. It’s so frustrating as this is my only way to get around the city (I can’t drive even if I could afford a car) and it just seems like people have no respect for others who have to use accessibility futures. I also have had my fair share of creepy men follow me into the elevator just so that they can be in an enclosed space with me that I really don’t appreciate.",1

"I'm lucky my office moved so I can take Metra. It's a 15-minute walk to the station, which certainly wasn't ideal in the rain yesterday. Once I'm on the train though it's reliably quick to get to Ogilvie. I can even get a seat if I get up a bit earlier.",1

"&gt; It's so frustrating, and no one in power seems to be invested in actually fixing this problem.

The problem cannot and will not be fixed without better funding and that will not happen unless people make their voices heard. Leadership is a problem but we could clone 10k Pete Buttigiegs and it still wouldn't solve the funding woes.  

Compared to peer transit networks, CTA is woefully underfunded so we get a woefully underwhelming transit system.

It will never improve until more people ask for it to be improved.",1
"Agree. I commute downtown and back from Rogers Park twice a week and for the last couple of years, almost half of my trips have had some kind of significant problem (not just a 90 second delay waiting for signal clearance).

It's all the construction on the north side Red Line. They are building 3 different platforms and raising the track up several feet all at once. All this creats slow zones. I also think there are less trains in general on the Red Line.  Both of the stations in my neighborhood have been closed for years and getting to the temp one is a pain due to building construction on the same street. Keeping my fingers crossed to finally see the end to construction and a normal commute.,0
Some of these comments make me feel like I’m being gaslit but I feel your pain. I take the blue to red from the west side and am experiencing at least 2 severe delays weekly. Every week I get closer and closer to buying a car.,1
This is why I’m a member of a Fix the CTA advocacy and working group. CTA is a treasure and I don’t take it for granted.,1
Sad to see so many stories pushing people away from transit towards car ownership; should be the other way around,0
I used to transfer from brown to red at Belmont from western but have found the same problems as OP. I’ve just decided to stay on brown all the way to the loop and have found that to be more peaceful/faster than trying to transfer. Sometimes it takes an extra 10 but I’d rather be sitting and moving the right direction then waiting on the platform debating if I’ll make it in time. CTA timing issues seem to have gotten much worse post COVID but that’s just from personal experience.,0
"I haven't taken that route in a long time, but I understand your pain. I remember back when I was in college there would always be delays and problems at Belmont, and this was in the '90s, and then later in the '00s I'd have the same issue when going to various workplaces. 

I was living in the Northwest end of Lakeview near Irving Park and Ashland. Not sure where you are at. 

One thing I started doing that got me to streeterville a lot faster. Was to to get my butt over to Clarendon and Irving Park and take one of the various 140-something buses that would run down Lakeshore drive to Michigan avenue. More often than not it would get me to work pretty fast.

If that's not an option, and you can have a slightly longer walk from a Brown line stop to your work, start utilizing the tracking system so you can get an idea of what's coming to Belmont. If you're rounding Southport and you can see that the next Red line train to Belmont will be in 15 minutes, which is long, or you're pulling in a Belmont and see a massive crowd, then you can just stick to the Brown line and keep going. That was another option, although back then we didn't have the tracking 

This is what I like to use to track the trains. I just found it works really well:

"I take the red/blue daily, and EVERY SINGLE DAY I’m mad. Like not only do I have to wait 12 min at the blue line stop, but then transfer and wait another 12+ at red. and then just so goddamn crowded you are smashed against someone the whole ride. It’s also 80 degrees on the fucker. 

It’s a test in patience. Legit. I’m honestly considering buying a car because as I get older the more unbearable it gets",1
"The problem with the CTA is not the CTA’s fault. It’s the public that is causing these issues. The trains aren’t breaking down. The tracks don’t have issues, and the employees know how to do their jobs. 

The delays happen because people are causing the delays by creating chaotic situations on the train or on the platform, which forces the CTA to stop the trains 

The city has a huge homelessness issue, where there are homeless individuals with mental issues and drug issues. Those individuals need to be in some type of institution or rehab facility , but instead they camp out around bus stops and train stations. They will make their way onto a train and cause all types of chaos, which will lead to major delays and interruptions for normal, everyday riders.

Also, the pandemic heightened the matter, because prior to the pandemic the city had a 
decent foundation of order and structure to it.
But when the pandemic occurred, safety and security went out the window because the city was in an emergency crisis. However, after the pandemic ended, that order never returned ….

That’s a situation that’s needs to be addressed by city government and the Chicago Police Department….",1
"While technically Google says it's faster for me to take the train, I live smack dab between the nearest CTA train and metra, just under a mile in either direction. I almost never do that though because it's a bus to either train and I'd rather just take a bus into the loop. Less stress and chance of delays without a transfer. Maybe look into an alternate option that makes it one straightforward trip? It might be a little longer, but it will be much more predictable IME.",1

"Similar situation except I get on a redline and transfer to a brown line to get me closer to my office downtown. Luckily all the companies I’ve worked for have an understanding that when you arrive is dependent on the CTA and give you some leeway. 

Some days you get lucky and other days you get to work 20 minutes later than you expected to. Bright side is this leeway most companies give you can be exploited and gives you some flexibility in the morning to wake up 10-15 minutes later than normal cause your boss isn’t gonna yell at you for showing up at 9:15 anyway, or at least the bosses I’ve had.

Wish it could be improved but it is what it is",1
"For contrast, the Blue Line is impeccable these days. It was pretty bad post pandemic but those days are gone.

It's improved dramatically over the past year. I never wait more than 5 minutes for morning train. I can only remember one event recently with delays.

Don't know of any data to back it up but it seems like mechanical issues and delays that plagued it for years have started disappearing since the arrival of 7000 series trains. They are comfortable and quiet too.

I understand the frustration but why not leave a bit earlier? Transit is never going to be perfectly on schedule and on time every day.",1

"I remember in the 1980s, a friend of mine and I were taking the L down from Loyola to Clark &amp; Division (we had a school thing to do on a Saturday morning). As both were AB stops, we could take any train heading south.

I think around Fullerton, there was an announcement that the train would be going express to Chicago or Grand; we figured we might as well stay on board and catch a train north from there.

When we got there, the next train showing up northbound said they were going express to Fullerton. So, we decided to wait for the next one after that. We were terribly late.

It was the days before cell phones, and I don't recall if we had enough change on us to call the school; I don't think so, because we also didn't know the direct dial number for the teacher's office, and the main school line wasn't answered on Saturdays, obviously.",1

People used to find that ""charming,"" were used to hour long commutes, and also realized that living in the city came with some dirtiness / grime / crime (though the cigarette smoking is a new phenomenon that I agree needs to be stopped).

Now with Uber / instant gratification syndrome, it seems like patience for 5 - 15 min commute time variences is slimmer than ever.

That's not necessarily a bad thing as pressure to modernize our system should be elevated these days. I'm just adding perspective for the transplants who, it sounds like, don't understand that the CTA never got brown line folks downtown (with transfer) in under 45 - 60 min.",1

"My biggest point of confusion is why people continue riding.

Born and raised in Chicago, daily CTA rider for many years, same with my wife. 

Historically, the only thing that affects change in society are boycotts that affect a bottom line. Not protests, not ads - boycotts.

I moved about a year ago to be closer to a Metra line and couldn't be happier with the increase in quality of life taking it everyday. 

Reliable, safe, clean, and I'm downtown in 22 minutes without fail (unless someone jumps in front of the trains, which is such a rarer delay compared to the delays on CTA - once in the last year it has affected me). 

I will say, as has been said before on this sub, the CTA was bearable (even enjoyable) up until probably 2019 or so. Anyone who says this is normal is has not ridden it very long. It is tragic what has been allowed to happen here.

I just couldn't let city/CTA leaders continue laughing at our complaints, making money off my misery on the CTA (without taking it themselves), and keeping their jobs while refusing to make improvements. So I was forced to make a change. I recommend everyone else who is able consider the same. 

I understand people may have limited options, but I had to make a huge change and others should get creative with these solutions too. If you are near Metra (there are stations in the city), take it. If you can, bike. If you must, drive. Move so you are closer to work or another transit route. Look at other [Transit Options](https://cookcountytransitplan.com/how-to-get-around-chicago/) the county put together.

"I mean... I guess it depends on your route. I haven't had issues taking the train / bus to downtown for work for the past year. 30 - 40 min max from Uptown.

Part of the problem you may be running into is the old spoke and wheel layout of transit here. All lines / major express buses lead to and from downtown. The other part is the slow recovery post COVID. And then the other part is a historic track rebuild project.

But in any case, it's totally possible to be a carless family here. We are with two kids.

Hang in there, and I encourage you to bitch to CTA at their meetings. It'll get back to being better.",1
"This is the absolute best public transportation in the midwest, by a long shot, despite the delays. The midwest is just car-centric.",1
The green line is fuckin atrocious. I’m late several times a week no matter how early I plan which is no exaggeration.,1
"Regarding pauses on the far north end of the red line, this is mostly due to a combination of the reconstruction and modernization project which is tbf almost done.

While I'm not happy at all, I've noticed an anecdotally improved experience on the red line at least.",1
I think this depends on where you're going. I haven't had much issues with the train this past year. Much better than it was a couple years ago during the pandemic but not back  to pre pandemic levels. Before covid the CTA was very reliable. It's getting better so hang in there,1
"It’s getting worse because the already narrow streets are getting bike lanes. Example in some places the right turn lane was eliminated , other places two lanes were merged into one lane and so on .",0
"Rotten culture of incompetence up to the very top, bloated union sabotaging the hiring pipeline, big fiscal cliff looming, deferred maintenance and capex mean the system is crumbling to shit. 

There’s zero political will to fix any of that. In a nutshell the mayor and his appointees think you should buy a truck to drive in like a real man.",1
"lmao the same reason the city has a huge deficit every year, all of the pensions are not even 50% funded on average and same reason that the school system does such a bad job to the students. It's the Chicago Way.",1
"I guess we’ll see if I eat my words, but I think we have reason to be a little more optimistic about rail service improving by the end of this year compared to years past. The CTA is doubling its rail operator training capacity and its operator headcount is trending upward. It started a similar aggressive hiring strategy for buses last year and we’re almost fully staffed, so I have at least some confidence they’ll be able to do the same for rail",1
"I live in the South Loop but most of my friends are near Boystown. I take the Red Line back and forth all the time. It gets me where I need to go effectively, even with the delays. 

As someone who’s never had a driver’s license, I’m perfectly able to live in Chicago without a car.",1
I live in Indianapolis and I am so jealous of your city’s train system everytime I visit I love it. I could see how this would be very frustrating for commuting/ every day life though!,1
CTA Board Meetings: [https://www.transitchicago.com/board/](https://www.transitchicago.com/board/),0
"Unlike private business, executives in public transit have not really paid attention to the customer and the customer experience.  In cities like Chicago, this is a major problem which continues to be a very tough problem to solve when leaders and politicians have zero political will to address the problem as crime and bad behavior.  What you end up with is unreliable service and an unsafe customer experience.  Most transit agencies are to afraid to call it what this really is.  Dorval Carter will hide behind the racism excuse and so will Brandon Johnson while never addressing and solving the problem which demands more policing and security.  After the police do their job, you ban the bad actors from the system completely.  Lifetime ban.  Race hustlers are very good at pointing the finger to let themselves off the hook.  Until new leadership is found or elected, the system will continue to deteriorate.  It's not difficult but with Kim Foxx, and others like her in positions of power, the city and the state will continue to lose people.  It's that simple.  A civilization has rules and if you want to behave like an animal you should be treated like one.",1
"Why are you going south to go north on your commute? 

Montrose and Clarendon is under a 15 minute walk to the Wilson stop where you could get the red or purple line to go to Howard.

There are also a few bus options that could take you up Sheridan or across to the red line by where you are.",0
"I also recently moved here (1 year ago) and am moving back east mostly because of the public transit situation here. I just don’t find life here without a car comfortable.

Outside of downtown, Chicago is a car city IMHO.",0
"I wish you were here in Boston the last 2 years to see what a shitshow it has been, CTA is 100x better",1
"In terms of bus service, CTA is actually running enough buses to, in theory, provide good service on every line despite what a bunch of activists will tell you. The problem is the road design which prioritizes parking for passenger vehicles above all else. This induces a ton of people to drive a car when there is a perfectly good bus available. Because people are induced by the road design to drive a car, the amount of vehicles on the roads increases immensely which leads to more traffic which leads to impatient drivers who cutoff buses constantly which leads to delays on the bus line which leads to excessive numbers of customers waiting at stops which leads to more delays as they board the bus which leads to bus bunching which leads to more impatient drivers which leads to more delays which leads to bad service overall.

Now you might ask, why doesn't CTA fix the roads? And the simple answer there is that they have no power other than to recommend to the owner of the roads that things need to be changed. They perform traffic studies and produce data showing that often the vast majority of the traffic on roads would be better served by buses with dedicated bus lanes which would not only move people faster but also speed up commercial vehicles moving through the city. IDOT and CDOT then look at these studies and use them as toilet paper. Although CDOT is now using them a bit more for their intended purpose thanks to reform efforts by Mayor Lightfoot and Mayor Johnson. 

Now onto train service, when the pandemic happened the Chicago Transit Board (the 7 appointed individuals who manage the CTA and who pass ordinances governing it) voted to keep everyone employed at their present status (hours scheduled per week). As their cash reserves ran low, federal dollars came in and helped back them a bit. However, the reduction of customers by 90% at the worst point with still a 30% reduction combined with not furloughing any employees or reducing hours had led to the agency estimating that they will have spent through all of the COVID relief funds by the end of the 2024 fiscal year (June 2025). Because of this, they slow-rolled the rehiring of train operators such that they'd get hired and trained back to full staffing in 2024 (this will occur by the end of the year based on current projections) as the majority of the customers were on buses and thus that's where most of the revenue would be realized. So train service has largely just been on a best effort level of life support. As each class of operators graduate, they add more service beyond what is scheduled to try to get us back to pre-pandemic service levels. Of course, that is also frustrated by CTA finally getting infrastructure funding after decades of underfunding to do very necessary maintenance and reconstruction of existing tracks. That introduces more delays than usual. 

As for police related delays on transit, those aren't new and they can't control them. Before the pandemic, I had at least one delay per week just going to and from work due to police activity or medical emergencies on the trains. CTA has repeatedly asked the state for the ability to form its own police force and to have money to rebuild the entire system with PTC and barriers at every station to prevent intrusion onto the tracks. The state has repeatedly denied both.

Unlike what most people think, Dorval Carter is not incompetent and he's leading a ship which has been propped up by the parent agency, RTA, since the 1980s with 100% of the RTA's discretionary funds because the state doesn't properly fund CTA and has repeatedly denied them the authority to self-fund their own agency. Now that ridership is still not recovered and relief funds are running out, we are rapidly approaching a massive fiscal cliff created by state law that will short the agency by at least 25% of their operating budget in the 2025 fiscal year.

As for differences between NYC and Chicago where you regularly see more celebrities in NYC, well I regularly see local actors on the trains and buses here. If you go to the Addison, Belmont, and Fullerton Red Line stops during rush hour, you can watch millionaires board in the morning towards the Loop and de-board on their way home every single weekday. You just don't know who they are because they are just executives and tech workers and traders working downtown. We don't have as much in the way of a standing media presence or theater industry as NYC or Los Angeles partly because both cities offer things to the ultra wealthy that we simply don't and mostly because they're bigger than Chicago. And well, in NYC the only good way to get around Manhattan most of the day is on MTA while Chicago is pretty easy to get around on CTA, bike, and car in comparison.",1
It's the extra illinois corruption,0
"Big transit supporter, but consider an e-bike until the weather makes it unmanageable. CTA will improve if enough noise is made, but it will take time.",1
"Chicago's govt really needs to understand this. I want my gf and I to move to Chicago. We both want to move out of Texas. When we visited Chicago, I talked up the transit.. ""Second biggest in the country!"" I said. Well wow the experiences turned her off A LOT. If Chicago wants to attract high salary remote workers and also world class talent of any stripe, IT MUST FIX THE TRANSIT. It's just so embarrassing. From everything I read, isn't the city going broke from lack of tax dollars..? Like compared to coastal cities, isn't Chicago kind of struggling per capita? It can not afford to put people off like this.",1
"I would have left out the part about the CTA’s attitude toward bums, which is just a figment of your imagination.  It sounds like you’re saying “hey CTA, classy people ride the bus too, so schedules matter”.",1
"There was a society altering pandemic that led to the CTA losing a lot of employees. They are just hiring back to pre pandemic levels. 

That’s why service is ass.",0
"It was not always like this, and you're living though the worst I've seen it. As long as we have a president of the CTA that thinks complaining about delays is racist it will not change. We need to kick his ass to the curb, which with this less than worthless mayor, I'm not hopeful. Although I'm hopeful BJ will be a single term mayor.",1
"Reasons:
-Chicago is broke so funding is inadequate.  Biggest culprit being overpromised and underfunded pensions. 
-Remote work has reduced ridership which has squeezed the budget.
-Politicians (Foxx, Johnson, Evans, Pritzker, Preckwinke) have pushed policies that make it hard to keep bums and criminals from ruining the trains. 
-Manpower shortages leading to canceled routes.  Also related to budget issues since wages can’t be raised enough.
-Union protects bad operators and won tons of PTO with no coverage plans leading to canceled routes.",1
"I’ve lived here since 1993. It’s always been bad. I’m betting it’s not going to change. Most operators don’t give a shit either. Security just stands around talking to each other. Certain people love forcing their presence on you or love making people uncomfortable with music, smoking, being ridiculous and ignorant. It’s a fucking joke. The delays, ghost buses, and bunching have always happened and won’t get better.",1
Only been here since September but im letting my lease go in August. Fuck this. It is embarrassing and im tired of getting ready for the day just to smell like smoke or sweat or whatever odd smell of the day the car is,1
"I just got back from South Korea. CTA is on some absolute BS. The trains there are so nice, clean and efficient, both subway and regional trains.",1
"Just remind yourself that the trains only go in two directions. It’s not like driving where you could end up literally anywhere. If you get on a train going the wrong direction, you can get off at the next stop and get on one going the right direction. Before you go somewhere, write down the steps you need to take, and just follow them. It will become second nature before long.",1
"In short a few things:

1) Leave early to allow room for mistakes or unexpected delays.  It's ok to make a mistake as you're learning how to navigate.

2) Use transit apps to plot out your route, memorize the important details like transfers, bus routes, and the station/bus stop where you need to get off.  i.e. At the Belmont station, I need to get off the red line and transfer to the brown line.

3) Just do it.  Practice makes perfect, especially if this is forming a routine.",1
Try the transit when you don’t really have anywhere to be. It’s way more stressful when you have to get to work or to an appointment. Just ride the routes and stop for coffee/lunch on the wat,0
"Google maps. It will tell you what stops to take, when the trains (supposidly) are supposed to come, etc. I didn't have a smart phone when I moved to Chicago from a small town over 10 years ago and I still sometimes get emotional riding the CTA. Why? Because it's very liberating, knowing I can get anywhere on my own, without a car. I was so isolated growing up poor in a rural area, public transit was such a life changer. I live in a close suburb to Chicago now and do have a car, but take the Metra whenever I can. It's wonderful. The anxiety goes away when you realize you aren't out any additional money by transferring. If you go the wrong direction you can easily get another direction. If you're nervous about safety, sit near the driver on the bus or in the first car with the conductor.",1
"Practice makes perfect, you’ll learn your routes and feel at home in no time. Cta workers will help you if you ask nicely and need help. Lots of other comments about apps and guides and writing out your plan are all good tips. 

I also want to mention that understanding the city’s grid, and starting to learn the major streets in their order really helps you understand exactly where one is or is talking about in the city. Every 400 and 800 block is evenly spaced, down south the numbers make this super easy. But once you learn the order is the major blocks, it’s really easy to understand how the city is organized. It’s actually very orderly, relatively. Not a requirement, but it helps me feel familiar as I move around. Thanks to my aunt who lived her whole life here and taught me about the grid and cta when I first visited applying for school. She was amazing",1
"Think of the traffic and parking nightmare and realize that even if delayed, the train is much more pleasant than having to deal with that. At least that's how I frame it for myself.",1
"The easy thing about the CTA is that each line only has two endpoints. After a short while of living here you will very easily memorize which end points are in which direction. The ease of using public transit primarily lies in your understanding of the city geography itself and not so much the train system.

You will get a hang of which trains go where very very quickly",1
"Google maps gives you step by step transit instructions you can save on your phone. You get used it pretty fast. And Chicago’s transit system is pretty well designed so it’s kinda impossible to get lost. If you’re moving here, I’d just spend a day riding the routes or the line you plan on transitting daily. Also get the Ventra app where it makes buying fares super easy.",1
"If you feel like there’s something or someone sketchy on a bus or train you’re on, don’t hesitate to move seats or train car! For example if some guy is smoking a cigarette and is speaking like a schizo.",1
"I moved to chicago from a midsize city with terrible public transit and it took me a bit to get used to it. In addition to the advice about leaving early and recognizing that the train goes both ways, I would say a good way to get used to it is to pick some sites, stores, or restaurants you want to try in other neighborhoods, and use the cta to go check them out on a day off. You'll get to see the city and you'll get use to bus and train travel.

The other thing you can keep in mind is that, despite the reputation, chicago is a pretty friendly city, and if you're really lost you can ask people for help navigating. When I first moved here I was puzzling over the train map and someone came up, unasked, and offered help. And Ive been asked for directions or offered help to lost-appearing tourists.",1

Wear sunglasses and put earbuds on. If people can't see your eyes, it helps you avoid unwanted solicitation.

Like someone said, give yourself plenty of time to get somewhere, as there are always delays.

If you do have a therapist, I would highly suggest bringing this up to them. If you don't, just take it easy and take it one step at a time.",1
"When I moved from my small town where you literally had to call the one bus service for a ride to a city with actual busses, I panicked. Given, this was also over a decade ago, so Google maps was worse.  I messed up one day, and you know what happened? Nothing alarming! I road the bus around the wrong end of it's route after getting on the wrong way, got a slight snicker from the bus driver when we stopped at the station for his shift break and I said I needed to go back the other way, and that's it! If you're going anywhere where timing is crucial, make sure to plan a bit of time padding (I like Google maps, but they definitely plan for everything to run exactly on their calculated times), and don't panic!",1
"Spend a few days planning out your route for school, for work, for home, for the grocery store. Will you be utilizing the bus, the train, walking, biking, or a combination. Then you take it and you make mental or literal notes about the steps you’d need to take. I’d utilize either the cta map, google or a third party app to give me the directions, but I’d use key markers to notate where and how. 

For instance, I’d need to take the redline from north/halsted. The entrance for the train is directly across from the Apple Store on the southern side of halsted, once I’ve entered and swiped or tapped to pay, I’d proceed down the flight of stairs. I’d make note of what’s the south destination and north destination. I know that 95th/dan Ryan is south and Howard is north. I’m going to the loop, the loop is south of me, so I’d continue to follow the directions for the southbound platform. Etc etc but I’d outline 

Step 1: find entrance
Step 2: head to southbound platform 
Step 3: exit at train stop I need 
Step 4: so on and so on. 

The nuances will come later, for instance you’ll learn which train stops have multiple entrances/exits, where you can connect to other trains, and so forth. If you mess up and confuse yourself, just stop and center yourself look at your directions again and try it out again. If you still can grasp ask someone. The platform attendant, the bus driver, the random person on the street, most likely someone will help to the best of their ability",1

"For the train it'll help if you know the end station that is the direction you want to head in. For example, if i'm downtown and i want to go to Milwaukee/Damen on the blue line, I want to get on a blue line train to O'Hare. 

You'll get the hang of it quickly.",1
Remember that even those of us who have been doing it for a decade or more sometimes fuck it up.,0
"I started taking public transit by myself when I was around 14 bc I had to start commuting to high school. I was in summer school and my dad met me at school and took the whole route home with me. It helped a lot to go through the route with someone who was familiar with the way the el and buses operate and it made me a lot less nervous when buying my train card and swiping it to get on the platform. If you have a friend or family member from here who uses public transit a lot, ask them to go with you the first few times you use  it and go somewhere fun to take the pressure off. 

Also if you ever feel uneasy, sit in the first car. I always felt safer when I was near the conductor.",1

I'll use Google Maps to plan the route I need to take.  Usually Google Maps provides many different options.  Sometimes it suggests the train or the bus.  I always will make sure my Ventra card has enough money.  I also will look up the route for returning, since it could be a different bus or train.

"I was once told that the trains and buses are meant to cater to the lowest common denominator- you are almost definitely not the dumbest person to be riding the train at any given point in time, and if all these other people can manage it, so can you.

"Hi! I'm also a transplant from a small town! I've been taking the train and bus since I moved almost two years ago and it's honestly not that daunting.

I recommend riding the train more often first as I think it's easier (only north and south as another commenter mentioned) and you don't have to request your stop. The bus is also pretty easy but you have to pay closer attention. Utilize google maps, the Ventra app and in your early days try to sight see and get around the city exclusively through the CTA.

You'll be just fine and will love the CTA in no time!",1
"Do it a hundred times, your anxiety will be replaced by boredom and irritation. 

I used to be terrified of strangers, now I just ignore them, or they annoy me, or occasionally they make me laugh. 

In my 10 years of commuting, I have been actually afraid maybe 5 times.

Take right now, there is a dude 5 feet away from me, rolling around on the floor of the train and yelling. I can tell he's going though some kind of crisis, and probably would be dangerous if I tried to interact with him, but for now I just wish he would fuck off, and that's it.

Update: in the time it took me to type this, he fucked off to another car. Hurray!",1

"I first moved here as a student at SAIC. I moved  from a small town too! I started getting comfortable riding the train just a few stops in either direction and exploring that area, then going back home via train. I repeated this on several different trains until I felt more confident riding further away from 'home'. Back then I thought River North was WORLDS away from the Loop where I lived in dorms :) Also I eventually started meeting friends who lived farther out in the neighborhoods and that was encouragement to explore more and feel confident that a 'familiar face' was waiting for me at the other end of the train. ",1

For example, living in Boston, I always open Citymapper to find when the next train is coming, because Apple Maps doesn’t update as quickly and usually isn’t as accurate. But if I’m just walking the city, Apple Maps is my favorite to use because it’s the least confusing",1

I would confirm that the stop I'm going to is on the list in the correct direction. Then when I get on the bus or train I would do the same thing, look for a list of stops and confirm I'm moving the right direction towards the stop that I need. Like others have said, note the stop before the one you need to get off so you hear it announced in time to be ready.",1
"I would say that most people are probably “nicer than they look”.

"The more you try it, the easier it gets. Regardless, keeping your awareness is key for being a kind rider and also for your safety. Big fan of getting on the first train car—it’s near the driver and usually a bit less crowded, since it isn’t right in front of the platform entrance.",1
You can always find someone happy to help point you the right direction.,1
It’s a lot easier than the bus I’ll tell you that,1
"Speaking for myself, the way I dealt with it was to just keep taking it, day in and day out.  I came to Chicago growing up in a town of 1200 people. After a while it becomes routine, where you can still stay alert, but do tasks on your phone and/or read.  Nobody really cares about you or what you're doing. 

There isn't a whole lot to ""navigate"" in Chicago with regard to the L trains.  It's not a complex system like the subways in New York or the Underground in London, where a map is really needed even if you're pretty familiar.  With Chicago you need a map to start with but after awhile you'll get the hang of the lines you use regularly and won't really need a map anymore. As I was getting familiar with things I'd sometimes take either the red or the brown line to my work downtown - it was fun getting both the above ground and the below ground perspectives.  Now I'm all about speed so just take the red line unless there are problems.

Most people using public transit in Chicago are heading to or from Downtown; that's why the announcements and the signs refer to ""inbound"" (toward downtown) or ""outbound"" (from downtown) trains.  

You can always get off a train and either wait for another train either going the same direction or moving the other direction.  If I ever feel uncomfortable on a train or if I miss my stop that is what I do.

The other thing I would do when I was getting familiar with things was I would take the different lines over the weekends.  So like I'd take the blue line to O'Hare and the Orange Line to Midway and explore the area around the airports.  Then I took the brown line, the purple line and the yellow line and explored the neighborhoods in those lines.  There is a series of PBS episodes called ""Chicago by L"" that provide interesting neighborhood explorations if this will help curb some of your anxiety.  Exploring the city is a truly fun thing to do during the weekends when the weather is nice.",1
"Google maps usually always tells you what to do. The arrival times aren't correct tho, you'll have to use CTA train tracker. Always look at the signs and make sure you're at 1.the right stop. 2. The right line 3. The right direction. For example. 1 Chicago and Franklin 2. Brown Line 3. To Kimball. It's the same for the bus. Look at the bus stop and it will tell you the name of the bus (66) and the direction (to Austin). 

I moved from a super small town and had very little experience with public transit and I initially took many wrong busses and trains. Usually I would realize it by the first few stops and I didn't end up too lost. I was so inexperienced I actually didn't even understand how to use the stop request cord on the bus - I thought the bus would automatically stop at every stop and I didn't have to tell the driver to do it. 

I would say after about a month I was fairly comfortable with riding public transit, but I also rode it frequently all around the city.",1
"I think I’ve read all of these suggestions and no one has said anything I had in mind 😆 as a single woman in Chicago, there are a few things I thought were helpful to learn early on:
- all cities have dangerous and creepy people who use public transportation so if you’re going to wear headphones, keep the volume v low or don’t have anything playing the first handful of times so you can hear the train or bus alerts for where the next stop is; there are also digital signs on most train cars that will show the next stop, and the bus always has that at the front by the driver
- the CTA and pace buses use a pull wire to indicate when you want to get off: you have to pull the wire when your stop is announced or they won’t know to stop (esp if no one else is getting off)
- pace buses are more so for the suburbs so you likely won’t need to use them, but it’s nice to know the difference so you don’t get on the wrong bus
- the CTA red line train (in Chicago we call it the el) goes north to south for most of the city’s length; the blue line goes east to west - these are the two most commonly used el lines, but all lines start and/or transfer from the Loop which is downtown Chicago
- the Metra train is NOT a CTA train: similar to pace buses, metra is a convenient way to get to/from the suburbs for folx who commute to work (or want to get from the south side to north side faster)
- on a busy train car and bus, always get up a stop or two early to wait to exit: you might get caught in the midst of other commuters before making it off if you’re not prepared, esp on the el
- the el is based of color lines, the buses are all numbered
- download the Ventra app so you can avoid losing your fare card; you can add it to your digital wallet as well",1
"Go out waaaay before you need to arrive, and if you miss something you have time to correct. Eventually you’ll know your stops. Won’t change the fact that you’ll also eventually miss them because of your phone or something. 

But basically don’t do your first navigations of a new-to-you route with a tight deadline.",0
"You aren't trapped in there with them, they are trapped in there with you",1
"Make sure not to wear shoes in your house, cuz likely somewhere on public transportation, you were standing in urine.",1
Just time and iterations. Realize that many have done it and do it. It becomes second nature.,0
"Chicago is a grid. The East numbers are odd and West are even. If you know the address you can picture where it is on the map. Knowing this you will get a feeling how far it is from you and how long it takes to get there. I'm a farm boy too. 40 years ago. Oh man, I've been here a while. I still put ketchup on my hotdogs. [Only at home]",1
"I would suggest asking a friend that you can go with so you can both try together. The CTA bus drivers and transit workers are very helpful and want to assist you if you ask, don be afraid to ask questions, they want to get you where you’re going. Also I say this as someone who stutters and has anxiety lol",1
If you have to ride the redline or god forbid go south of Roosevelt make sure you have a loaded gun and be ready to shoot,1
Using google or apple maps to help navigate the trains or busses helps so much! Tells you what stop to get on and off at very clearly.,1
I would suggest not wearing headphones.,0
"Ok, so I didn’t move here from a small town but I did move here from the suburbs and had a substantial amount of social anxiety upon moving here. Some of my anxiety was from driving in general, so that was automatically relieved by selling my car and relying solely on transit, biking, and my own two feet.

1. I got this handy app called Transit. It’s a lifesaver and it’s a lot more reliable than Google Maps. It helps me feel confident about where I’m going, when I’ll get there, and how I’ll get back home.

2. Wearing headphones! Listening to a podcast, audiobook, or some music while on the train or bus is my favorite pastime. It also helps me tune out loud noises and disruptive conversations.

3. Take the same train or bus a couple times in the same week, for commuting to work or for no reason at all. Once I have my familiar routes, I have a lot less anxiety while traveling because I know where the stops are, what neighborhoods they go to, how much traffic they might get stuck in depending on the time.

You’ve got this!",1
It will be like clockwork before you know it. CTA apps help with timing...,1
"If you find yourself riding Metra trains you will quickly find your anxiety easing. It's a safe laid back experience. I was at witts end with driving too and from work. The sheer stupidity and pure ignorance on the roads and highways on the daly commute started affecting me hours after I got home. Now I sit on the train and read or play games on my phone instead of getting pissed at the world.
The most important thing with trains is stay out of there way. Never underestimate how unforgiving all that steel is.",1
Use the CityMapper app to tell you where and how to go through the transfers. It’s a step by step guide you can set from anywhere in the city and the data is updated in real time.,0
Practice and preparation,0
"Download the Ventra app, it gives you real time updates on train locations and step by step directions to get pretty much anywhere in the city. (What train/bus you should be on, what stops to get on and off at, how far away the next train or bus is)

99% of the people on the train just want to be left alone and quietly get to their destination. It’s totally fine to wear a hat and face mask and mind your own business if you are feeling anxious.",1
Walk with conviction like you have somewhere to get to (you probably do!) as opposed to aimlessly wandering around.,1
"Google maps is the best way. Ive lived here 10+ years and still use it constantly to navigate busses and routes i dont take frequently. 

Just put your destination in, select public transit as an option and start your route. Itll even buzz your phone or play a notification over your headphones when your stop is approaching.",1
"Google maps and transit maps on the CTA help a lot.

No different than taking public transportation in any city around the world.",1
"One thing I did when I first moved here, wear headphones and have your Google maps on!  This way you can hear directions as you travel.  I used it more for walking purposes but let google maps be your friend ❤",1
Ride it more often and the anxiety will go away. Anxiety does not go away by itself you have to push it out with experience.,0
I lived in the Chicago area for 40 years and once you can get a hold of a CTA map to start you should be ok as I wouldn't expect you to know the area like still do but know in due time you'll know the Chicago area like a champ,1
"Using it a lot. Like biking on busy streets, it can take some adjustment.",1
"I just kept doing it until I wasn't nervous about it anymore. I've made a few mistakes and gotten on the wrong train or bus, and then it turned out that wasn't quite so horrible as I thought it might be. And the CTA drivers are all really nice in my experience, and happy to help point you in the right direction.",1
By cycling.,0
"Just do it? Fuck people are weak sauce these days.

Anxiety is a side effect of being outside your comfort zone.  Being outside side your comfort zone means you are learning and growing.  The more you do something the less anxiety will occur.  Go do it, make mistakes, rinse and repeat.  Asking other Redditors how to manage feelings will only delay the growth.

Fun fact: this is a life pro tip, not just a CTA exclusive fix",1
Just walk up and punch the biggest guy you see on the train in the mouth.,0
I got a girlfriend the first year I moved here that taught me everything.,0
"As someone who did just what you said… I didn’t get over the anxiety😂

I lived in Chicago for two years and I don’t think I used public transportation once. Given, I had the privilege of having a car and a parking space, so if I was going somewhere I usually either walked or drove.",1
Quincy.,0
I like the view from the Wilson red line stop!,1
Armitage Brown Line - love the neighborhood right around that area + Annette’s in the summer. Always pretty quiet at that stop too and only 10mins from the loop,1
State/Lake—the views of the Chicago Theater's lights and Marina Towers make it feel quintessentially Chicagoan.,0
My favorite old school station is Ashland on the Green/Pink. Also love Quincy and Washington and Wells for Loop stops. Love getting off on Addison and seeing Wrigley Field. Also Armitage of course.,1
"Quincy. Love the preservation effort at that stop, sometimes I'll even go out of my way to use it at the end of a long day.

Honorable mentions:

Armitage: gorgeous surroundings and historic charm.
Washington/Wabash: beautiful and interesting modern design, perfect for visitors heading into the Loop..
Garfield Green Line: Nick Cave's artwork and the original 1892 station house across the street.",1
"Cermak Chinatown Red Line!:) love the view that looks out over the old side of Chinatown to the west, and if you look north, the train tracks kinda curve away into the distance towards downtown, it's cool imo!",1
Sheridan Red Line &amp; Damen Blue Line,0
I really like the classic feel of Central in Evanston.,1
The Harold Washington Library one is one of my favorite ones,1
"The giant piece of the Berlin Wall at Western brown is something most people seem to not be aware of. The station itself is otherwise pretty crummy (I think they're putting in some work). 

&amp;#x200B;

I've always liked the Ashland Pink/Green too.",1
Sure as shit isn’t the Division blue line,1
probably rockwell. so cute and love how it's folded into the middle of the neighborhood.,1
Ashland green line!! Absolutely gorgeous. The Germanic cottage look of the station is delightful.,1
Damien blue line in Wicker Park. I just love the aesthetic 🙃 and I love the views from Chicago brown/purple,1
I like the ones where the tracks are on the ground like on the brown line and purple line,1
"My favorite line is the brown line. Incredible views when headed toward the loop. As for stations, Rockwell and Francisco brown line stops for its relaxed and neighborhood feel. California blue line stop for the beautiful tile painting on the ceiling.",1
"18th, where the station art IS the station.",0
Wabash/Washington! Lovely views and that cool roof.,1
"Un ironically Sheridan. 
It's got a cute built in mini grocer. 
Beautiful views of the trains as they round the bends. 
Sure it's a bit dingy but it's charming.",1
Jarvis red line. It’s so quiet and it has a great view of the neighborhood.,1
The 95th red line station is really cool and well designed! I love the futuristic aesthetic of it. It just sucks that everything around it is boring or ugly.,1
18th pink line. The view down 18th 🤌,0
I like the 63rd red line stop!,1
"Idk about my favorite, but the most interesting is def the Roosevelt red line stop",1
"Southport Brown Line - so much to do right off the stop, pretty nice station, easy to get to Red Line from there as well.",1
"I can't say I have a favorite station, but there's a lot of them I like for various reasons.

I do think Paulina has one of the best views, but I dislike that it's such a high station that lacks escalators.

I like that Linden is such a quiet station. You get plopped off into this sleepy little suburb just a few blocks from the Baha'i. It's also the northernmost station in the system.

I like Quincy because it preserves those elements that the old L stations had. What I dislike is the layout of the station and how narrow everything is.

State/Van Buren is really neat and it seems like the architecture was inspired by the Library. The buildings surrounding the station are nice too. I dislike that you can't enter from the west end of the platform. 

I can't say I like any of the stations along the Red, Orange, or Blue Lines. The subway stations have such a boring, derelict, aesthetic. There's nothing to like about expressway median stations. The Orange Line's stations are also boring. Big platforms are a plus, but that's it. They're in such crumby locations too. To be fair, a lot of the L stations feel similar to each other and I wish more of them had their own aesthetics and designs. 

If I truly had to pick one station, idk Francisco is pretty neat.",1
"Francisco brown line. Grabbing a cup of coffee at First Slice, relaxing while waiting for the train, and being able to take the “single seat” are my favorite things of my morning commute.",1
Controversial but I really like Wilson. It’s massive and looks super modern while still being spartan and functional. Plus you can basically walk straight into Target,1
Irving park brown line always smells like Indian food because of the restaurant right next to it. 10/10 would smell again.,1
I like the pink line Kedzie stop. It’s in a cool spot right above the neighborhood and the station operator guy (not sure if he’s still there) would wave and say hi to everyone. It had a cool cozy vibe to it. If I’m not mistaken it gets used a lot for tv shows as well due to the tracks going right past the houses. Yes I’m aware it’s in north lawndale.,1
CHICAGO RED LINE!! It speaks Chicago to me when I moved here,0
Quincy is probably the best L station- I also love the Damen Blue line! My favorite subway stop is probably the Grand red,1
Tie between 18th and Damen on pink line. Unfortunately too many people agreed with me and I got priced out of the area but I still have lots of nostalgia for it.,1
18th Street Pink Line stop easily. So much art and so colorful.,1
The closest one to my house,0

"Quincy on the brownline.   


Clark/Lake stop on the Orange/Blue/Purple/Pink/Green line cause it's also where Spider Man 2 iirc was filmed and it gives an excellent ""inner"" view of the city.",1
I like the redline Berwyn stop. I like the view of the neighborhood from it,1
"I'm not sure if any one station hits all the bases, so I'll cheat out and pick a few based on what you listed:   
Ashland Green Pink for Aesthetics - I love when cities aren't afraid of letting infrastructure be weird. Yes, a Victorian cottage train station in 2022 is weird, but I find it really cool and well designed, and I love that the city actually kept the look when they rehabbed it. Close second is O'Hare. Wait what? Yes really. I think it's a great case study in doing a lot with a little: the wave glass block and concrete recalls a time when brutalism meant something. Yes the Quincy retro is cool (and a design award says so too), but I think the more notable recent CTA design is the (also awarded) temporary [Berwyn](https://loyolaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/phoenix-cta-1-1.jpg) station. 
  
Cermak-Chinatown for area around the station - the station itself is nothing to call home about design wise, but the view and neighborhood is incredible. It is the sole Southside Redline station that is not underground or wedged in between the Dan Ryan, and that elevated, direct, SSW view of the city at night makes me homesick for a city I'm standing two feet away from. Ping Tom park is almost at your feet, it's great, Wentworth is in a class of it's own. Close second is Linden, but with a caveat: it is still dropping you right off next to some incredible shit- between Baháʼí, the lake, the canal, NU's Ryan Field, I think it's fantastic that transit gets people up there, but the area immediately around the station really used to be a bigger part of the experience. Today, it's pretty much a ghost town but in my youth it had an incredible diner (Mr's Ds!), an old fashioned grocer, a neighborhood hardware store, and an incredible barber who cut my hair for over a decade. That's all gone now.       
Honorable mention: Sheridan red line, it is a hot mess that smells like tar in the summer and will try and sweep you off your feet in the winter, but between that curve (#realstationshavecurves) and the ambiance of being just outside of Wrigley, just below the quiet anguish of Buena Park, encroached on by the beer stained B10 college sweatshirt of LKView East, it is special. But it is simultaneously still a huge mess.",1
Merchandise Mart.,0
Washington/Wabash,0
Logan Square for sure!,1
"West side of Harold Wash/State/Van Buren platform. The view up Dearborn surrounded by Guilded Age and turn-of-the-20th-Century gems (Fisher, Monadnock, etc.) is gorgeous.

Armitage Brown Line is another close contender. Puts you eye level with some of the most beautiful facades and roofs in the city.

Views from Chicago Brown are also stellar at night, especially as you look down Wells to the Merch and Sears.",1
"Washington Wabash Loop,

"My favorite L station is the Ravenswood station on the Brown line. The Ravenswood station was the namesake of the Ravenswood line before the CTA changed the L lines to a color-coded scheme. The station was located at Wilson at the alley, just west of Ravenswood, west of the Metra tracks. Ravenswood was originally an affluent suburb and was incorporated into Chicago in the 1880s. To the east of the station on Wilson Avenue were little shops and I remember as a kid a Rexall drugstore, Ruby cleaners, and possibly a butcher shop. There was also a YMCA and the neighborhood is full of very big houses. The Ravenswood station was dismantled in 1949, a couple of years after the CTA took the L lines over.

Red/Blue Jackson 🤙,0
Sheridan red is sweet. Also a sucker for 18th pink,1
"The train Station on South Loop does it for me. Especially when I’m coming home from work and catch the sunset. The way the sun sets over Roosevelt road makes it look straight out of a wallpaper. The orange hue, the slow car traffic and lively ground traffic always makes for a memorable sight. The elevated platform also lets you see the shedd aquarium and it looks majestic at night.",1
The L stop at the Garfield park conservatory it feels so old school and a neat little view of the park.,1
18th st. Pink Line. I wish more stations were covered in art from the neighborhood like that.,1
Armitage. Love the buildings right be the stop if you face East.,1

"The Brown Line has been 25+ minutes late for me twice in a row. The worst part is the tracker app displaying ""&lt;1 minute"" the entire time, rather than updating us on when the train will actually arrive.",0
There has been utterly zero leadership on the CTA’s issues. It’s shocking.,0
"I’ve started to file a [customer service form](https://www.transitchicago.com/feedback/) for every issue I encounter while I wait the 45 minutes for a 78 or 30 minutes for the red line. Operator’s being great? I file that too. 

At least then there’s some data because they certainly don’t care on Twitter. 

I try to be nice to the operators when riders are unceremoniously told after already having boarded and travelled several stops there will be shuttle bus service etc. etc. while expressing how garbage it is that no one even bothers to put up signs about the diversions. The CTA admin is putting their front line people in some tough spots, and need to do better by them.",1

Like they lost a TON of employees who succumbed to covid, covid death, or they simply left when things got too shitty in the city. I don’t blame them. 

A lot of public workers left the industry and aren’t coming back. So everything is slower. Mail, deliveries, trains and buses. 

That can o my be fixed if they hire and train more people. Which they’re actively hiring I see more signs than usual. But I also see these for literally every public service job from nurses and cops to bus drivers and mechanics. 

We’ve severely underestimated how many people covid displaced. 

That aside. 

The disrespectful behavior; smoking, eating, spitting, fighting and robbing people that’s a matter for the police to solve and right now it feels like we’ve 100 cops covering the entire city and half of them are making TikTok’s on their phones or smoking in their cars. They’re not actually patrolling. 

We need more beat cops actively walking the beat and monitored to be MOVING. They don’t move they don’t get paid. No more glorified hall monitors. 

We need to start leaning on Lightfoot to fix this or she’s out. Everything fell to shit around that woman after 8 crap years of Rahm defunding everything.",1

"Fundamentally, the CTA answers to the mayor. Nothing is going to get better until the mayor cares. Right now the mayor's race is a crowded field. Talk to candidates and make this a major issue in the upcoming mayoral election.",1
"Transit systems across the country were in a mess before Covid, and the pandemic simply accelerated problems and issues that have been building for many years. Right now, the CTA is in a rush to get from terrible to bad, after losing staff and ridership and as stations and trains got older, and riders encountered increasing lawlessness and filth. A city like Chicago cannot operate without an able CTA of trains and buses, and the system needs to be addressed as a vital public service like sanitation, police and fire services. It's not a convenience, it is actually vital to the survival and growth of the city.

Right now, we are contending with operations getting back to some semblance of normal, and yes, it will take years. But simultaneous to that there has to be very public planning to address an aging infrastructure, replacement of trains, station redesign, capacity planning, technological advancement, and the like, and using federal dollars, as available, to rethink, rebuild, renew.  That does not solve phantom trains, which I encounter every time I take the green line, but is at least an investment in the future.",1
"I take the 77 Belmont bus and the blue line to and from work. The blue line has mostly been alright, but the Belmont bus has been terrible for two years now. More than 50% of the time on nights and weekends when I get to the stop the tracker will show no buses because they're all 40+ minutes out. I've spent more money on taxis and Uber in the past two years than I did in my first 10 years living in the Chicago area combined.",1
I would like to thank the CTA for finally making the DC Metro seem well-run by comparison.,1

"Here's the thing. Ridership is about at 57% and the CTA is only providing 71% of it's pre CoVid service I believe.

So hiring really isn't the fucking issue.

Just balance out the schedules and upgrade the trackers and they would have 80% less problems and complaints.",0

By that logic, they should designate shitting and pissing cars too. Perhaps they could even be the same as the smoking car.",1
"The west side buses are focking horrendous. The busses are usually early to the app’s ETA. And the following bus is 20-30 mins delay. 

To add, I have to connect to the Damen or Ashland bus which if missed is another 20-30 min delay. It’s a nightmare.",0
"It really sucks. I’ve stopped wanting to go places because I’m worried it’ll take hours to get home, and Lyft has gotten stupid expensive. Actually started wondering about going back to cabs/car services. But yeah, ideally the fucking CTA should just do better.",1

"r/carfreechicago might be a good place to start

Unfortunately, Chicago has a massive debt problem, and services like public transportation are underfunded as a result. Increasing fiscal austerity measures are in our future and it’s going to suck. IMHO the best solution would be to get rid of minimum parking requirements &amp; allow more infill development, which would enable the city to collect more $$ in tax revenue.",1
"Thank you for making this post. Was close to doing so myself. 

The last few weeks have been dog shit atrocious on CTA. Got stuck around Harrison with buses ghosting, trains not even scheduled, and Uber costing like $80. 

Not having confidence public transportation will show up on time will make zero ppl depend on it.",1

"I was excited to see a ton of new 'security', then I realized all they do is stand in the spot where they will 100% be in the way of people trying to get anywhere. 

The CTA has just turned toxic for me. I used to brag to other big city friends about the CTA, now I wouldn't take company visiting me on the CTA to get somewhere unless I had no choice. Between the homelessness problem, more and more people acting like unapologetic assholes on the train, employees who are on the same 'don't fucking care' level as the DMV workers, the level of filth and gross smells on basically every train now, and the all-new '30 minutes is the new 10 minutes' in terms of wait times...fuck, I might just bite the bullet and buy a car, fuck the CTA they haven't earned any of my money.",1

"The rest of these comments offer great advice so i don't have much to help with. But, from my experience, I have been catcalled left and right in broad daylight by all genders on the red line, one lady even followed me off a stop just to comment on my ass, in front of my own boyfriend, too. A CTA employee was there and did nothing to stop it. I know it's an unrelated issue conpared to their timing, but thankfully i have a car and I intend to use it more often bc I do not feel safe even with my partner. I know the employees deal with a lot already, but it's unacceptable to let things like that slide. I hope all these issues resolve soon. Covid, labor shortages, abuse in the workplace, etc. Has all taken a toll on the quality of public transit.",1
"Just don’t fault the workers who are showing up.  I feel bad they take the brunt of complaints about slow service.  The smoking and bums on the trains is out of control. What’s it going to take? Jail?  At the point of that- especially for smoking, and thugs aggressively moving from car to car through emergency doors.",0
"Look into your alderperson's voting record. If they're not supporting progressive public transit, knock doors until they're voted out. Same with the mayor.",1
"[crowdsourced Transit app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/transit-subway-bus-times/id498151501)
check out the transit app! the app (for chicago at least) uses crowed sourced location tracking and cta trackers to tell u when to leave to get to ur stop!  

if your someone who rides a long ride, id also recommend this app, especially with headphone use! it tells u when ur two stops away from ur stop :)

not a cta solution, but a time tracker *potential solution!",1
I got so fed up with CTA. I invested in a bicycle. It took a little lifestyle adjustment but I’m really glad I did. p,1
i waited for an hour today on the pink line adams and wabash station only for the CTA worker to say over the intercom that loop was shut down due to server outages,0
"They are understaffed. If in a position to do so, take a job there and change the culture from within.",0
"Blue Line has gotten significantly worse for me the last few weeks. I get on at the Chicago stop going towards O'hare after work, and its become damn near impossible to get on a train. I just go south to Clark/Lake stop and get on there going back North. Backtracking sucks, but I can get on the train there every time, so it's been saving me time.",0
"Apple Pay at the turnstiles have been down for over a week now and the crazy part is once you add your card to Apple Pay, your physical card gets deactivated. That is the dumbest thing in the world to me.",0
"Adding people boarding who try to push past the people trying to exit. Like… beyond being rude, you’d think they understand that if I’m off the train, there is more room for them.",0
"The one that's getting to me lately is these people who will stand directly in front of the doors, not even sideways, like fully blocking one side of the door, and they don't consider even taking a 1/4 step to the side so people can get on. What's even more surprising to me is that I'm the only one I've seen that doesn't just meekly squeeze past them. Like if I'm trying to get on a train and I'm met with someone's entire back in my way, my midwestern conflict allergic ass is absolutely saying something while I shoulder them out of the way.",1
Imo most people are just in their own world. I’ve had to tell people plenty of times to move over to let me sit or ask ‘is this your bag’ before the person picks up the bag and makes space.,0
"I fucking love shoulder-checking oblivious backpack wearers on the Blue Line at rush hour. You get about a second and a half after ""excuse me"" before I go for it. UIC, Loyola, etc should have transit etiquette videos as part of the numerous student trainings-- pretty sure students not knowing how to behave on transit was what normalized it",1
"CTA etiquette is probably the worst I have seen in 15 years of riding. The advent of smartphones has been terrible — you can put your phone down and hold your backpack to squeeze 3 more people on a rush hour train, Instagram will be there when you get home!",0
"I hate to sound like an old guy but the backpack thing has gotten way worse in the last 10+ years. It used to be the norm to take your backpack off and hold it, now it is the opposite.",1
When they don’t take off their backpack and then hit people in the head with it.,0
"The backpack thing drives me crazy. It is not so difficult to take off your backpack and set it on top of your feet, but it just doesn’t seem to occur to 90% of people. I pretty much always take off my bag while standing, with rare exceptions if I’m on a nearly empty car or something.",1
"I totally agree with you about the lack of etiquette on the L, and it seems to be getting worse now that more and more people are using it during the work week. I'd also include the increase of vaping/ smoking cannabis - especially in the last 2 cars of the L. (although on the ride home from work, it only bothers me for the first few minutes... and then I'm totally chill about it for some reason...)",1
"&gt;I thought that was common sense?

Once you start paying attention and realizing that what *should* be common sense isn't for most people, you start realize just how stupid and unaware people are.

I would consider having common sense a skill trait. A skill trait that the vast majority of people don't have.",1
"My pet peeve is when people don’t use the designated “exit” turnstiles during rush hour and instead use the ones meant for entering. While I know you CAN exit through the entrances, it’s pretty rude when you can see there are people waiting to enter.",1
"Well, I ride from the Damen stop on TWTh and am usually *one of the sardines* that need to pack myself into the cramped space since trains get full around that stop in the mornings. 

I've noticed that people onboard *telepathically* are saying:

&gt; ""Y-You better not come on board. There isn't any space.""

To which I am *telepathically* saying,

&gt; ""Oh! Watch me. I'm going to make space."" 

*and then I proceed to take off my backpack* and squeeze in.

All jokes aside. I think people onboard already want to preserve their space and purposely don't acknowledge that others are trying to board. That and people are usually plugged in to their audio devices.",1
"Even before reading the post I knew it was about the morning commute on the blue line. Because I know how you feel and 150% agree we need more people to adopt NYC commuter etiquette.

"When I first moved to Chicago, I remember the middle aged CTA riders yelling at people to make space or let people off etc. I am now that middle aged CTA rider. I try not to be a jerk about it, but I will tap people on the shoulder and point out that their backpack is blocking the access to the middle of the car. Or tap someone on the shoulder and point out that there is space in the center of the car and we could get more people on the train.


They look surprised but they are basically never rude about it. I really think it is being clueless and not malicious. ",1
Do unto others as …. should be the standard everywhere,0
"Not a pet peeve. More of an irrational fear. I hate when the backdoor won't open on the bus. And everyone's like ""Push it!!!!"" while I'm pushing with my legs. Or when it opens with a feather's touch, but I'm expecting it to be stiffer than a nun.",1
One rule should be no blowing smoke rings while smoking,0
It’s always been a problem. I like to point out that one of the verses of wheels on the bus is the driver saying “move on back.”,1
"It took me about a month of being here before I started loudly saying EXCUSE ME, LET PEOPLE OFF, and MOVE IN. I know that's a lot for some people but it's much better (and more effective!) than trying to squeeze by and then stewing about it after the fact.",1
"sometimes i get on the train and then realize there is no room to take off my backpack without smacking someone, I do try to though. I get so frustrated when people crowd the door when theres open space near the seats",0
etiquette and CTA do not belong in the same sentance,0
"Just to be up front, I haven't taken the CTA regularly during rush hour in about a year and a half, so take that how you will. 

There is SO MUCH more shit on the CTA that I have to be bothered by than backpacks.   Should people take them off?  Sure.  But I can think of many things that bother me WAY more including:  Using the bathroom on the CTA, homeless people taking up a row of seats, smoking, playing your music out loud, leaving trash, harrassment of others.  

Even the not getting off, I understand.  I've had situations where I did that, then I had a hard time getting a decent spot to hold onto when I got back on",1
My thought: there isn't any.,0
"It pisses me off immensely to the point that I no longer take the train home during rush hour. Not taking backpacks off, not moving in, taking up two seats. Like damn I get it but if you don’t like it then fucking move. It’s the same in the bus (especially express busses) but it’s aggravating. It’s like common sense and camaraderie is just gone.",1
I think it would be a good idea.,1
Many have headphones in staring at their phone obvious to what’s going on,0
"Backpack off and in between your legs, while standing.
You never know if your backpack is smacking into a kid’s face.
Also, it’s much easier for someone to unzip and steal shit, with it on your back 

I will purposely stand against someone’s bag, so they can’t turn their body. Serves them right",1
Welcome to the 3rd biggest city in the US. The fact we have a semi decent transit system is a win. I witnessed two people verbally assault each other for 6 mins on the Redline from Chicago to Jackson at 8:30am. Nobody blinked. Car was standing room only.,1
"I really thought etiquette on public transit was common sense, being raise in Chicago it’s a natural response to take my backpack off and place Tetris with my body around cart. BUT it’s when a ton of people  get off at a stop and those imbeciles don’t wanna shift to the side or step out is when the shoulder checking begins.",1
"ALSO! When people get up in the middle of the train moving and trying to squeeze past people to the doors. Bro it’s packed enough, where TF are you going, sit down and chill",0
People who lean their whole body against a pole when the car is crowded so short people like me can’t get a handhold are my main CTA pet peeve right now. They’re always surprised when I fall over for some reason,1
From nyc- people here don’t move into the car. Everyone crowds around the door. Also people not taking off their backpacks and putting it between their legs,0
Ppl talking on their phones with the speaker on drives me nuts. I do not want to hear your conversation. Spare us.,1
"Once a week I have to shove past someone blocking the aisle, facing away from the doors, wearing their headphones because after 2 “excuse me” I am done being polite",1
I used to carry stickers with me that said “I am a rude asshole”. Not removing your backpack? Sticker.,0
"It's unfortunately normal. It seems like a lot of people have absolutely no concern for anyone other than themselves. Some are intentionally antisocial, but I think most are just completely oblivious. That's not an excuse for them btw.",1
There's etiquette on CTA?,0
"I’ve never seen anyone take their backpack off, and I’ve become quite aware of it since I’ve been reading people complain on reddit. It does seem like basic courtesy to move when someone is exiting, if I’m near the door and it’s easy for me to do so I will hop off and back on to let people out.",1
BAN BACKPACKS FOR PEOPLE AGE 23+. Briefcase lifestyle.,0
"How do we feel about phone calls? I take them on the train sometimes, but I always feel awkward about it",0
"In my opinion, the best way to create a cultural change are posts like this for awareness, along with the support of the system as a way to set ground rules (signage), gentle teaching (primarily parents, family, friends; secondarily strangers), and a mature understanding that sometimes people are in their own worlds. Don’t act like you all have never been in your own worlds. I know I have. To this day, we are all throwing stones in other people’s glass houses, and we still haven’t noticed the cracks we’ve left behind while we’re over here telling people not to throw their rocks.",1

Howard. Having to go up and then back down to go to the platform isn’t my favorite thing.,1
"Addison Red Line.

Relatively short, narrow platform that only operates redline trains. Cubs fans clog up the platform and it’s hard/dangerous to shuffle around the crowd because the platform is so narrow. There are no purple or brown lines stopping at the station to ease the congestion. And you can only enter through the north side entrance.

Whole station is terribly designed to be THE station for Cubs games/ Cubs crowds",1
"Loyola seems pretty bad. Extremely narrow platforms, and it’s also hard to see how they are going to expand the station if they decide to make it a purple line stop as well.",1
Probably State and Lake for me. I always get scared I'm going to be pushed off when its busy.,0
The one in the middle of a highway,0
"I have three criteria for a badly designed station:

Land usage, design, and operations.

The worst land usage, potentially of any train station in the entire country, is Rosemont Blue Line. If you’ve never seen it, it literally sits in the middle of a cloverleaf interchange. It’s functionally inaccessible by foot.

The worst operations in the system are Howard and I don’t think anyone is arguing that.

The design I personally hate the most is split between any of the highway stops like 47th Red Line or Illinois Medical District.
That’s a cookie cutter answer though, and there are many of those everywhere, so my “unique” answer is Loyola on the red line. Platform is dangerously small, outdated, and the inbound/outbound platforms are separated from each other.",1
"Irving Park.

Incredibly narrow platform.

in the middle of the Kennedy (noise, pollution, wind)

Entrances/exits are only in filthy underpasses.

Pedestrian approaches from most every direction are seriously treacherous.

No accessible entry.",0
"Sheridan is pretty rough. I don’t think it’s worst designed, but it needs some renovation",1
"Logan Square if entering from the Spaulding side. You could be at the turnstile, train will roll up and you’d miss it because it is so far.",0
"*Designed*? Granville red line isn’t the worst, but is pretty terrible, mostly because there is one exit, and there is a part of the platform *which is about 12 inches wide* that everyone has to walk on to get down to the street level when they leave a train, and you could get smacked by the train as it starts departing- easily.

It’s an accident/death waiting to happen.",1
"Granville is also extremely narrow. When passengers get off the train and are heading to the exit, they are sandwiched between a glass enclosed escalator and the departing train. There’s barely enough room for foot traffic in one direction, and people try to stay very close to the glass on the opposite side. When there’s foot traffic in both directions, the risk of slamming into the moving train becomes very high.",0
"State and Lake — excessively narrow, rundown, reeks of piss, and no accessibility options",0
State and lake. Platforms are too narrow and there’s no mezzanine level,0
Outdated design doesn’t really bother me as long as they are safe and clean.,1
"Maybe not the worst, but California blue line annoys the hell out of me. Climb the stairs, then almost always have to carefully squeeze by everyone waiting on the very slim platform.",1
Sheridan. Narrow but also feels like I’m tilting.,1
belmont blue line. why the fuck is there not an entrance to the subway on the northeast corner of kimball and belmont so the west bound 77 busses dont have to do an unnecessary (and difficult with traffic) loop into the blue line,1
