      "I love it. It's like a museum artifact that doubles as a transit system. Parts of it for sure need upgrades, and the city could benefit from some new, modern metro-style lines like Sydney and Toronto are building, but the character of the current L is such an iconic part of the city's character.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question though - to what extent is our affinity for the L limited to the actual elevated parts? Like, are the subways under State and Dearborn considered as 'special' as the turn-of-the-century style elevated portions of the network?\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps it could be intriguing to preserve one station as a 'Historical Gem' to honor its original design and significance. However, for the hundreds of thousands of users, as well as those working, walking, or living nearby, the overall state of disrepair these stations are in is quite disheartening. The glaring issues range from their poor condition, a lack of accessibility features for people with disabilities, to the excessive noise, inadequate lighting at night, limited space, and overall instability. It’s puzzling to see how this line has not been prioritized for renovation. In many other countries, a project to modernize such a line would have been undertaken LONG ago.\n",

      "\n",
      "Yeah, I love the L. I go to Chicago frequently to moderate Quiz Bowl tournaments in Rosemont and usually take the L downtown before the tournament starts so I can sightsee.

I would also like to see either a western or Ashland loop or line. Connecting with maybe the 47th and Western Orange on the s side and maybe the western brown line.  It seems like it would be pretty good coverage if they do that.  And ohare midway line might be helpful but I would put less priority on that unless they make it really fast, with a connection in oak park (cross the green line, and maybe Cicero hitting up either the metra or pink line). #FireDorvalCarter\n",

      "When comparing to other countries, Chicago's system is abysmal to say the least. Nowhere else have I seen people shouting nonsense in stations, smoking drugs on trains, trash everywhere, and absolutely useless theater security (not even New York despite what people also say there). Delays are bad, but the poor passenger information (Ghost trains/buses, no service announcements) make it even worse. Never have I seen timekeeping this bad and the operators don't seem to care. My trips to the Loop could take anywhere from 45 to 90 minutes.\n",

We have relatively reliable 24/7 train service that covers a significant percentage of the city’s population. The CTA’s customer experience is garbage. Trains are dirty, smoking is constant, during the winter trains are essentially homeless shelters, and staff aren’t responsive to concerns. I’ve found other agencies to do a better job in regard to this.\n",

      "\n",

Out of curiosity I actually started keeping a journal and I see on-train smoking or someone in mental/housing crisis about 1 in 3 trips. NYC was excellent across the board last time I was there. Trains in Buenos Aires were phenomenally clean and under control. Not saying outliers don’t exist in these places but seemingly at a much lower rate that made me sad to return to the CTA lol\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So talking only about my experiences **this year** (since 1 January 2024):\n",
      "\n",
      "**London (2.5ish weeks)**  \n",
      "TfL while it has good coverage with the Tube and the the buses go to most major things has a bad habit of not updating GIS data for known and planned events leading to such issues as you **and your bus driver** having absolutely no clue where you should get off the bus in order to get to your apartment. For the London Marathon, they didn't even bother giving route maps to the drivers, they were just required to follow road signage that was posted by the police seemingly at random with no coordination with TfL. This led to an extremely stressful journey from the train station that was supposed to get us close enough for a direct bus to our rented apartment when we had arrived after a red eye flight.  \n",
      "As for maintenance issues, TfL was incredibly clean in the paid/ticketed areas but had many of the QoL issues that we have in the non-paid/non-ticketed areas such as shit and piss. Wraparound services at the national level to reduce homelessness and open drug trafficking were very obvious but those are not an issue controllable by a transit system. However on the trains, we had several train seats that were obviously extremely far beyond their reasonably useful life with one almost stabbing me. We reported that seat to the a train operator and when using the same train 3 days later (by coincidence), it was not fixed or blocked off in any way.  \n",
      "In terms of runs and frequency, TfL was still very much facing staffing issues leading to decreased service in Zones 3 and 4 as they were short-turning a lot of trains in Zone 2. This was a major point of contention in the London mayoral elections that were ongoing while we were there. But if you're a tourist, you're probably staying in Zones 1 and 2 most of the time so you'll be lulled into thinking everything is peachy unless you go out of your way to experience Zones 3 and 4 right now.  \n",
      "Overall, the experience was similar to MTA in NYC albeit with worse coverage of the central area by train but better coverage of the outlying areas. The national rail system helps cover some of the gaps but the separate ticketing for in-city stops is quite frustrating. Coverage south of the Thames leaves much to be desired but that is the main area that TfL is working on expanding service in right now so they're at least working on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "**NYC Trip (4 days)**  \n",
      "I spent a bit in NYC this year. Now, normally I spend 1-3 weeks but as I'm in-between jobs, I chose to focus on other cities more so it was just a long weekend.   \n",
      "Last year, I wrote a great review of how MTA had clearly used the pandemic to fix a ton of maintenance issues and it felt so much better than pre-pandemic. This trip was a bit worrying though. Tons of maintenance issues had come up again and the lack of funding from the state for ongoing, preventative maintenance was definitely showing. The cleaning regime that had been put in place during the pandemic was clearly no longer being as strictly enforced and the experience was just worse compared to late fall of last year in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn.  \n",
      "Overall, **MTA is probably the best transit system in North America** but I still wouldn't rate it as high as Vienna or Munich. But I need to visit both cities again as it has been awhile. And well, Gov. Kathy Hochul is just another in a long line of NY governors trying to kill everything good about NYC.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Amtrak Acela (1 trip)**  \n",
      "Honestly, there's not much bad to say about the train. We took it from NYC to DC one week after they launched the new food menu and everything on the new menu was pretty decent for train food. The ride was smooth on the newer tracks, bumpy on the older ones, and was only a bit slower than I would expect of ICE trains in Europe. I guess if I had to criticize it, the seats are very dated and the patterns on the fabric is very visibly fading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: DC/WMATA and CTA commentary in my comment; ran out of space here\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Moved here from Philly and the CTA is a blessing compared to SEPTA. With SEPTA it’s easier for me to count the number of times I haven’t been on a train with someone smoking something. The homeless on SEPTA are also so aggressive and the city does nothing about it (I personally never had issues but knew people that got spit on, physically attacked, etc. Chicago homeless sure will panhandle you but I’ve seen less aggressive and dangerous behavior here. I’m a daily blue line rider and most of the time they’re just trying to sleep in one of the few places where they have a roof over their head, who can fault someone for doing that when the city provides next to no alternatives?). Also all the train stations are filthy with SEPTA, CTA does a pretty good job of cleaning the stations. Communication is also leaps and bounds better, CTA transit app has been very accurate in my experience, with SEPTA the app is not real time and there’s nothing in the stations that tell you when to expect the next train so it’s all a guess. And there’s no communication about bus detours like there is with CTA. Yes CTA can be better, but at least it ain’t Philly’s disaster of transit and for that I’m grateful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I tell my gf all the time the CTA is one of the worst I’ve experienced. In The US it’s top 4ish with MTA,WMATA, and NJ transit being better IMO.\n",

      "In North America CDMX, Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouvers metros all have better ridership\n",

      "I moved to NYC a year ago after living in Chicago for the previous 6 years. I live in East Harlem, not the nicest part of town.\n",
      "\n",
      "My experience is that I see way more drug addicts / homeless people out on the streets where I live now than I did in Chicago, but way less of that on the trains (though plenty in the stations).\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel way, **way** safer on both the streets and trains here in NYC than I did in Chicago. A couple years ago I had a crazy guy pull a knife on me on the purple line at 930AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here in NYC I've never experienced anything close to the things I'd regularly see on the red line after the pandemic. The CTA really is a nightmare compared to the MTA, especially after the pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worse than metros outside of the USA (because the USA lags behind pretty much every other developed country) and it's behind all major US cities. But for what it's worth, it's MILES better than what the majority of Americans have access to. The fact that there are several areas in the CTA network where coverage is so comprehensive that you can reasonably live without your own car is a massive privilege. Moving here from Cleveland, I was blown away by how competent of a system it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CTA is a solid system and it has good bones. It definitely needs help, better leadership, and more funding, but it's so much better than most systems in the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I can only compare it to Europe especially Cracow Poland, and Cracow takes all the awards, but it’s not a fair comparison because American cities are just different. The public transportation in Cracow is simply amazing. I am just mostly grateful for the CTA that it even exists, and I am super stoked to be living so close to the Red Line.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CTA is pretty good, Bostons been a shit show for the past year and a half, but it’s getting better.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The CTA train is very unsafe, the buses are fine. I took the train to the loop and a mental ill man sitting across from me was threatening me and said he will kill me and how he was going to do. I did not look him directly in the eye but I moved train cars as fast as I could, I was not waiting to find out. I love transit but the CTA trains are a mental asylum at this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to London, where I am right now, it is laughable in terms of frequency, coverage, efficiency, cleanliness, etc\n",
      "\n",

      "When my kid was at U of MN, I used that tram thing a few times going to and from the airport.  Wasn't a bad experience at all. What was bad about your experience? Just curious.\n",

      "\n",
      "I'm an outsider who's never been to Chicago so my insights will be different from a native &amp; that's the benefit. As someone who's had to deal with the issues of boston, I think there comparisons that can be made. Ofc I can't day definitely what will fix the issues of the cta, but heres my take. From what I've read here on reddit &amp; in the media it's a bunch of things which I'll break down in no particular order. \n",
      "\n",
      "Short staffing \n",
      "Without needed staff, busses trains &amp; other positions cause a snowball effect for other issues. If there's not enough people to do runs, more people need to wait at their bus or l stop to get to where they need to. This will deter ridership &amp; make things worse. \n",
      "\n",
      "Backlog of maintenance \n",
      "Perceived &amp; real safety issues:\n",
      "Safety matters in both a perceived &amp; real way. If you see dirty or unkempt stations or areas, you might think things are neglected &amp; not looked after. This leads you as a rider to second guess using the system.  If there's a real safety issue like people acting out or threatening others, you definitely will notice this &amp; might have issues finding staff for help. Either way the results are the same. You avoid the L as a whole. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Slow zones &amp; not enough equipment for needed service\n",
      "As someone who uses the t in Boston that's had issues with slow zones,  I know what it's like &amp; how they suck. This contributes to not having enough trains for runs. If trains need to run slower, less of them are able to finish runs &amp; be used again.  This also leads to longer headways discouraging usage. It's a situation that leads to 2 problems. With less trains in use users might turn to other modes. Even though there could be more demand for the bus, there's not enough personal to drive them leading to long headways just like on the l with the same result. \n",
      "\n",
      "It also doesn't help that many people want Dorval out the door, which is a 180 from boston, where the new gm has managed to turn things around in some ways.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it's a lot of problems &amp; there's going to be a lot of debate about how to fix things.\n",
      "\n",

      "I never fully appreciated the CTA until I spent a year living in San Francisco. CTA is by no means perfect, but at least it's not BART.\n",
